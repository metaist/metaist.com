## Summary (for a six year-old)

There are lots of different kinds of fireworks, but basically
they work by launching a bundle of things into the air which
explodes mid-air.

The different colors and arrangements that fireworks make is the
result of how the bundle is arranged and the kinds of materials
that are used.
