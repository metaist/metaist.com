## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Daniel Pink's [Drive][amazon] highlights several stark differences between
what motivation science tells us and how businesses and schools operate in the
areas of:

- **Autonomy**: choosing what you work on, when you work on it and with whom,

- **Mastery**: working towards bettering yourself in some dimension under
  optimal working conditions, and

- **Purpose**: working towards something greater than yourself.

## Commentary

While I was surprised by how much of this book I had already covered in
previous posts, there were still a few nuggets I learned along the way.

### Autonomy

Pink's arguments for giving people power over tasks, time, and team are cogent.
The much-discussed announcement that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo! new CEO, has
ended the [work-from-home policy][1] only spurs this discussion forward.
By contrast, the [work environment of Steam][2] suggests that high quality
output is entirely possible even when the entire process is in the hands of
employees.

### Mastery

Much of this section is devoted to explaining the concept of [flow][wiki-1]
pioneered by [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi][wiki-2]. It is similar to the idea
of a [Zone of Proximal Development][meta-2] and consists of keeping people
focused on tasks in which immediate feedback lets them know they are on-track
to achieve something just beyond their current capabilities.

### Purpose

The desire to sever a purpose or feel useful is not new (just watch a few
of the earlier episodes of [Downton Abbey][wiki-3]). However, Pink argues that
the issue of our work serving a higher purpose will come to the fore as
the [baby boomer][wiki-4] generation starts to age and face existential
questions of mortality and purpose. While there may be surge in purpose-driven
activities, I expect it to come more from the youth whose naïveté is likely to
drive a desire to make a mark in the world rather than from rich elderly folks
who hope to live out their days in stylish comfort knowing that they made it.

Especially interesting in this topic was the rise of the so-called
[Benefit corporation][wiki-5] which seeks to use profits as a means to an end
and is equally interested in maximizing social benefit as it is profits.
