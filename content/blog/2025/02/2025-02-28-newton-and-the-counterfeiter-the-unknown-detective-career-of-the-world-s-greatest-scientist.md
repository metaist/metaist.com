{% linkPost title, tags, link %} Why isn't there a movie about this!? Action-packed (warning: book starts off slow), crazy borderline unethical interrogations, law enforcement becoming criminals, criminals becoming informants, a brilliant nemesis, exacting calculations, fierce guarding of coinage. Now that we have the historical account, you could do a whole historical fictional series of about this.
