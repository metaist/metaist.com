{% linkPost title, tags, link %} One time I was in a meeting with over 100 people where we were told that we had to improve our performance by 10X year-over-year. After many rousing speeches of how important it was to 10X our performance, I asked the only question that came to mind: "For how many years in a row, do we expect to be able to 10X our performance?" The non-engineering speaker did not understand why all the engineers laughed.
