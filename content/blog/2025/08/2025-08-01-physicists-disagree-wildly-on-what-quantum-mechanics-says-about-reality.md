{% linkPost title, tags, link %} I took the quiz and received:

> You are probably content with a Copenhagen-like interpretation.
>
> You enjoy the idea that quantum mechanics is, in some way, able to describe the real world and you enjoy that there is some inherent randomness in the Universe. For you, the observer of quantum objects, and their classical world, is distinct from the quantum systems they interact with; a quantum particle's location and other attributes are not pre-defined, but emerge as well-defined states when an observer measures them.
>
> Exactly why a measurement triggers a shift from a probabilistic to a well-defined state is not clear, but our brains are macroscopic, so you donâ€™t let that bother you.
>
> You might be among the 10% of researchers who, according to our survey, said that the Copenhagen interpretation was their favourite approach, but who also think that the wavefunction represents reality in some way.
