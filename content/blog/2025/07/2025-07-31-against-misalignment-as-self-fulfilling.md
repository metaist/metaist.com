{% linkPost title, tags, link %} The topic under discussion is similar to [Ecclesiastes 10:20](https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.10?lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en):

> Don’t revile a king even among your intimates.
> Don’t revile a rich man even in your bedchamber;
> For a bird of the air may carry the utterance,
> And a winged creature may report the word.
