[`castfit 0.1.3`][release] is available. The biggest thing I did was implement [`is_subtype`](https://github.com/metaist/castfit/blob/08f6a5526ca5401702ce382200ea4cf9331ab3e4/src/castfit/__init__.py#L346) which is a forced me to [learn about invariant, covariant, and contravariant types](/blog/2025/05/til-typevar.html).

To install `castfit`:

```bash
# modern (recommended)
uv add castfit

# classic
python -m pip install castfit
```
