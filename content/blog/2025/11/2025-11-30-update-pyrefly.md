{% linkPost title, tags, link %} Turns out `pyrefly` developers saw my [previous post](/blog/2025/05/trying-pyrefly.html), broke things down into many sub-issues and fixed them all. `pyrefly` now reports zero errors in [`castfit`](https://github.com/metaist/castfit) and the errors it find in other repos have pretty understandable error messages!
