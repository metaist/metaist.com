{% linkPost title, tags, link %} Sequel to [The Name of the Wind](/blog/2025/11/name-of-the-wind.html). Patrick Rothfuss joins the ranks of several other fantasy authors in having an unfinished series. I ended up reading the rants of his fans and editors as well as counter points that authors don't owe readers books. This book was a fine sequel; not as great and a bit graphic at times.
