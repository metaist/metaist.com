{% linkPost title, tags, link %} I never heard of [Alfred Adler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Adler) or his school of psychology (he was a contemporary of Freud's). There are lots of commonplace examples which makes this an interesting read, but I suspect some of the claims are a bit too strong (e.g., "trauma" not being a real thing).
