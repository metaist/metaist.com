{% linkPost title, tags, link %} My process for selecting books is very different from Aaron's, but it's nice to see someone else's process.

Mine:

- I get recommendations from friends, colleagues, podcasts, and other books.
- I add them to a list (currently an Amazon Wishlist). I prefer digital books over physical books because I can make them into audiobook (at 4x) and they take up very little physical space.
- When I get to the end of the books I have in my queue, I sort the wishlist by price (lowest to highest) and buy everything under $5. That keeps me busy for about 3 months.
- I take all the books that I've purchased and sort them by the number of pages (lowest to highest). This is my new reading queue.

There are only a couple of exceptions for me to deviate from this order:

1. My wife recommends I read something next, especially as it may impact our kids. This bumps the book to the top of the list (both for purchase and reading).
2. I'm about to meet someone who recently published a book. There have been a few times where I got through their most-recently published book the day before meeting them. HT: Ramit Sethi who teaches the importance of being overly prepared for certain kinds of meetings.

I often get asked how much I retain from the audio versions of books. My informal tests show no more or less than most people when they read books. I don't remember every detail, but neither do most people. HT: Mike Masnick who introduced me to the idea of listening to podcasts at greater than 2x.
