## Release Notes [0.2.1] - 2025-12-24T18:35:27Z

**Fixed**

- [#42] minor typos; added links in README
- [#58] only do the Windows dance if literally trying to replace `sys.executable`
- [#96] files not saving to cache
- [#97], [#98] executable permissions for Cosmopolitan Python
- [#99] nothing being logged in binary build
- [#95] don't search for `pyproject.toml` when you only have `--script` to bundle
- [#104] error when using `cosmofy fs ls` with `--sort none`
- [#105] restore working directory after error when using `cosmofy fs add` with `--chdir`
- [#103] use context manager for `urlopen` even for `HEAD`

**Changed**

- [#106] `cosmofy fs cat` outputs raw bytes to `sys.stdout` instead of decoding to UTF-8

**Added**

- [#94] pure Python limitation to README
- [#107] clearer docstring for `expand_glob`; literal paths are returned exactly
- [#100] document that `pythonoid.run_python` intentionally destroys `sys.argv`

**Security**

- [#102] call `validate_url` at the start of all the `download_*` functions
- [#109] reject paths with null bytes
- [#108] don't follow circular symlinks endlessly
