[`cosmofy 0.2.0`][release] is available. So many things came together for this release:

1. Three open source developers I follow (William McGuan, Simon Willison, and Charlie Marsh) [were all in a twitter thread](https://x.com/TheMetaist/status/1996981507710235012) where the concept of something like `cosmofy` was mentioned.
2. I learned how to make CLIs [sort of work the way Astral's tools do](/blog/2025/12/emulating-astral-cli.html).
3. I learned just how many [crazy options GNU `ls` supports](/blog/2025/12/emulating-ls).

If you have `uv` installed you can use `cosmofy`:

```bash
uvx cosmofy

# or install it
uv tool install cosmofy
```

## Release Notes [0.2.0] - 2025-12-24T03:14:02Z

This release represents a very large shift from bundling individual python files to using `uv` to bundle entire `venv` directories. The behavior of the CLI is now much more similar to `uv` in form and function.

**Fixed**

- [#14] typo in `--help`
- [#43] exclude `uv` artifacts from the bundle
- [#46] `expand_globs` to follow all (most?) of the shell rules
- [#48] getting only the project's `console_scripts`
- [#50] `cosmofy bundle --script` assumes venv in output
- [#52] avoiding clobbering logging on import
- [#56] used context handlers to close temporary directories
- [#58] self update on Windows
- [#59] assumption that `Last-Modified` will be present in headers
- [#61] replaced `PathDistribution._path` with appropriate fallbacks
- [#62] replaced `assert` for validation with actual `raise` on error
- [#66] needless `pass` in parsing args
- [#67] command names in logging
- [#70] incorrect shebang in `bundle.py`
- [#71] used context handlers to close `ZipFile` objects
- [#72] download progress indicator shouldn't divide by zero
- [#73] missing newline in `bundle.py` error message
- [#75] explicit return of default when we can't get the version from a file
- [#77] `cosmofy fs cat` usage string
- [#79] `ZipFile2.now` should not be at module-level
- [#92] use public API for `SourceFileLoader`

**Changed**

- [#16] update examples, readme, usage (HT @Pugio)
- [#28] replaced `--debug` with `--quiet` + `--verbose`
- [#29] `DEFAULT_PYTHON_URL` is now Cosmopolitan Python
- [#31] replaced `--cache` with `--no-cache` + `--cache-dir`
- [#33] refactored `bundler.py` into subcommands
- [#55] switched to JSON parsing `uv version` output
- [#57] switched to using `os.replace` for atomic file moves
- [#64] replaced `removeprefix` with better cross-platform approach
- [#79] moved progress indicator to `stderr`
- [#87] marked `cosmofy updater` commands as experimental

**Added**

- [#18] progress when downloading (HT @Pugio)
- [#32] `cosmofy bundle --script`
- [#33] `cosmofy bundle`
- [#33] `cosmofy fs add`
- [#33] `cosmofy fs args`
- [#33] `cosmofy updater remove`
- [#33] dry run banner
- [#35] `cosmofy fs ls`
- [#36] `cosmofy fs cat`
- [#37] `cosmofy fs rm`
- [#38] `cosmofy fs add -f` to overwrite files that exist
- [#39] `--color` global option
- [#40] `cosmofy self update`
- [#40] `cosmofy self version`
- [#49] `--exact` to `uv sync` for better exact specs
- [#60] timeouts to network calls
- [#81] note that concurrent removals are not supported
- [#83] missing docstrings
- [#86] log message that only GitHub URLs are inferred
- [#89] warning when adding absolute paths
- [#91] note about handling weird file names

**Removed**

- [#15] `cosmo.yaml` workflow; added `gh` command
- [#17] default `.com` extension
- [#24] support for python <= 3.9
- [#27] `--clone` is no longer supported
- [#30] `--download` is no longer supported

**Security**

- [#53] added `validate_url` to avoid non-HTTPS URLs
- [#53] added security considerations note
- [#54] removed `shell=True` in places that don't need it
- [#63] added `sanitize_zip_path` to avoid bad entry names
