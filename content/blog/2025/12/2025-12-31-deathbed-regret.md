{% linkPost title, tags, link %} I agree with the main point of the post which is why I've usually taken deathbed regret and converted it into specific advice. For many years, I've had the following (lightly edited) list towards the top of my todo list:

- Don't ignore your dreams
- Don't work too much {no more than 8 hours on a normal day}
- Say what you think {but don't be rude}
- Cultivate friendships {every month}
- Be happy {by sheer will}
