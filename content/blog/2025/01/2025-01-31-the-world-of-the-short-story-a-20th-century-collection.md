{% linkPost title, tags, link %} During the pandemic I remembered that in high school I really liked short stories (efficient storytelling!) and I found this book from the Boston Public Library that was checked out back in September 25, 1993. Well after spending 5 years reading this book at a rate of 3-4 pages per month, I've come to realize most short stories are more weird than enjoyable. I need to search around for better stories.
