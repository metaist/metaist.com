{% linkPost title, tags, link %} In _Minority Report_ they have "futuristic" interfaces where you wave your arms around to manipulate 3D projections. In the real world your arms would get very tired very quickly. [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) tried to create a hypertext environment with lots of guarantees, but Gwern's realization about the UX is notable:

> **“Oh my god. It’s completely unreadable.”**
>
> The lines were confusing clutter, especially as they crisscrossed (a perennial problem in sidenotes layout, made far worse by the outlines). None of the ‘sidenotes’ were readable because the screen was so small. Even as you simply scrolled, for many possible settings, you were unable to read anything! How could a document UI where often you could read nothing have ever seemed like a good idea? The UI was just terrible—it could never have worked. Even on a large screen like my 4k monitor, I wouldn’t want that.

The lesson?

> So, to me, Project Xanadu is a case-study in why designers must mock-up and prototype their designs before too much is invested in them. Xanadu wasn’t the victim of “Worse is Better”; it was just a solution in search of a problem.
