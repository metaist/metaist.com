{% linkPost title, tags, link %} Nice essay about how vision is translated into engineering. Also discusses abstraction layers and how organizations are structured.

> However, there are two ways of interacting with an abstraction layer: as shorthand for an understanding of what it is doing on your behalf, or as a black box. I think engineers are most capable and most effective when abstraction layers serve as shorthand rather than a black box.
