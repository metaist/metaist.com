{% linkPost title, tags, link %} I knew about both [Kolmogorov complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity) (smallest program that produces an output) and [Shannon information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content) (probability of a sequence appearing in a large pool of sequences), but this was a cool way of combining the two concepts. Plus the craziness that is biology.
