[`castfit 0.1.2`][release] is available. [I previously asked both Gemini 2.5 Pro and ChatGPT o3](/blog/2025/04/castfit-code-review.html) to review my previous release and provide suggestions. While implementing those suggestions I ended up simplifying several things and making certain interfaces more consistent.

To install `castfit`:

```bash
# modern (recommended)
uv add castfit

# classic
python -m pip install castfit
```

## Release Notes [0.1.2] - 2025-05-21T20:54:51Z

**Fixed**

- [#4]: `get_args` on raw types
- [#5]: `to_tuple` with too-long input
- [#18]: handling of `types.UnionType`
- [#25]: delinted using `pyrefly`
- [#27]: `str` to `int` conversion when the string has decimal places
- [#28]: `float` to `datetime` conversion; added UTC timezone
- [#29]: handling an untyped default value in a class

**Changed**

- [#14]: `TypeForm` comment to clarify what we want
- [#19]: set instance fields based on class metadata rather than tried to put all the data into the instance
- [#22]: register converters based on both source and destination types rather than assuming that each function must convert everything to a specific destination type
- [#24]: renamed `casts_to` to `casts` and added support for short-form (1 argument) cast function
- [#30]: updated the public API to be more compact and consistent

**Added**

- [#2]: support for nested types
- [#3]: original cause of `to_type` error
- [#6]: additional `datetime` formats
- [#7]: custom casts to `castfit` (closes #7)
- [#11]: more README examples
- [#12]: more complete docstrings for the public API
- [#15]: cache for fetching `get_origin` and `get_args` information
- [#16]: `DEFAULT_ENCODING` constant for `to_bytes` and `to_str`
- [#17]: alternatives to README
- [#20]: infer types based on class field defaults
- [#31]: more negative tests

**Removed**

- [#21]: `castfit` on an instance instead of a `type`

**Won't Fix**

- [#8]: Gemini suggested having an explicit caster for `pathlib.Path`
- [#9]: Gemini suggested having an explicit recursive dataclass/class casting
- [#10]: Gemini suggested optionally collecting errors instead of raising the first one encountered. It's a good idea, but not for now.
- [#13]: Tried implementing a workaround for `TypeGuard` in older versions of python, but it didn't work.
- [#23]: Started and rolled back `is_callable` because `castfit` can't currently do anything with a callable that is the wrong type.
- [#26]: Rolled back having a `checks` parameter that overrides how types are checked.
- [#32]: Tried fixing `TypeForm` to be the union of `type[T]` and `_SpecialForm`, but only `pyright` was able to handle it. `mypy` still can't handle it and `ty` isn't mature enough yet.
