## Commentary

When we hear a child say "I'm sorry" when prompted, the insincerity is often
palatable. Similar apologies by politicians and CEOs of recent have illicit
similar reactions. What makes an apology effective?

Effective apologies should address:

1. which norm (personal, social) was violated,
2. acceptance of responsibility by the violator, and
3. how the violations will be prevented in the future.

If these ideas sound familiar, it may be because that's what we tell our children.
