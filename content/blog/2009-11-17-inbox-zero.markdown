## Technique

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com/video/) is a technique for processing your
email and somewhat related to the concepts David Allen put forth in
[Getting Things Done](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280?ie=UTF8&tag=themet-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142000280).

## Commentary

I have found Inbox Zero effective at dealing with the
[psychological barriers]({{BLOG_URL}}/2009/11/psychological-barriers.html) around
checking and responding to email. I've adapted the process so that for every
email (starting with the oldest) I choose one of the following actions:

- **Label & Archive** - This is the most common action since most of my email
  is purely information. By using filters, most the email is pre-labeled and I
  usually just archive it (or delete it if it's an unsolicited advertisement).

- **Star It** - I choose this for emails that require me either do something
  or that indicate that I'm waiting for something to happen (e.g., receipts
  for an order).

- **Respond** - Usually to acknowledge receipt of an email, or provide someone
  with a particular piece of information. This must take less than two
  minutes.

After all the emails have been processed, I view all the starred emails. I add
all the items I need to do to my task list. (I will discuss how I process the
task list in a [future post]({{BLOG_URL}}/2009/11/pomodoro-technique.html).)

In the past two years, I have maintained an empty inbox at home and at work and
have found that I spend more time doing what needs to be done rather then
[trying to keep it all in my head](http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0361923098000835).
