## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

If a change from X to Y results in at least one agent better off without making
any agents worse off, we call Y a
[Pareto improvement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_improvement)
relative to X. If no more Pareto improvements are possible, the situation is
said to be _Pareto efficient_ or _Pareto optimal_.

## Meta

When thinking about a proposed Pareto improvement, consider the _resistance to
change_ on the part of the people who will implement your proposal. You may
realize that your proposal is no longer a Pareto improvement because of the
non-monetary costs involved.
