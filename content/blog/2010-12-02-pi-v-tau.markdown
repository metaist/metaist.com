## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Pi][wiki-pi] is considered one of the most important mathematical constants.
However, there is a growing movement that suggests that a different constant
may be easier to use and easier to teach.

## Commentary

The value of _pi_ is a constant that relates the circumference of a circle
(length around the circle) to its diameter (length through the center).
In 2000, Bob Palais wrote a short article called
[Pi is Wrong!][2] where he outlined arguments for a different _circle constant_:
one that relates the circumference to the _radius_ (length from the center to
any point on the circle). In June 2010, Michael Hartl published Palais' arguments
as [_The Tau Manifesto_][3] where he suggested that the new circle constant
be represented by the [Greek letter tau][wiki-tau].

The main arguments are as follows:

1. While _pi_ appears in many equations, it most frequently appears as
   2<em>pi</em>. All instances of 2<em>pi</em> can be replaced by _tau_.

2. Measuring angles in [radians][wiki-radian] is much more straightforward
   because there are _tau_ radians in a circle (rather than 2<em>pi</em> radians).

3. The relationship between the [trigonometric functions][wiki-trig]
   and the unit circle is easier to grasp.

4. [Euler's identity][wiki-euler] ends up sounding even more powerful:
   e<sup><em>it</em></sup> = 1 (Read as: _A rotation by one turn in the
   [complex plane][wiki-complex] is 1._)

5. The area of a circle is in quadratic form similar to many other physical
   phenomena where two values are proportional to each other.
   [Examples][4]:

   - Falling in a uniform gravitational field (velocity is proportional to time)
   - Potential energy in a linear spring (force is proportional to distance)
   - Energy of motion (force is proportional to acceleration)

   So now we can add: Area of a circle (area is proportional to radius).

The arguments are persuasive and merit thought, especially for the pedagogical
benefits _tau_ provides. I suspect it will be some time before anyone adopts this
constant as a matter of course, but I have no problem writing "_tau_ = 2<em>pi</em>"
and moving on from there.
