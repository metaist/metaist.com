## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Wires are commonly associated with electricity. It is surprising, therefore,
that people thought electricity would never be adopted widely if wires were
required. Yet it was adopted, but we've only recently started to shed the wires.

## Commentary

Earlier efforts focused on charging pads such by
[PureEnergy](http://www.shoppureenergy.com/) and
[SlashPower](http://www.splashpower.com/). The cleverness of MIT's technique is
that it combines
[induction]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/01/electromagnetic-induction.html) with
[resonance]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/01/resonance.html) to achieve power at larger
distances. That is, the resonance allows more of the power to be transmitted via
induction to the receiver.

What are other potential uses of wireless electricity?
