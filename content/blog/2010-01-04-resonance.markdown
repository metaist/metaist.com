## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Resonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance) refers to a tendency of a
system to oscillate more at certain frequencies than at others. Those
frequencies are known as resonant frequencies.

## Commentary

An excellent example of
[acoustic resonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_resonance) is
[shattering a wine glass with sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17tqXgvCN0E#t=33s).
Here's a quick explanation as to why the glass shatters:

1. The [sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound) is being generated by a
   [speaker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudspeaker). The speaker works by
   moving a small cone back and forth generating the appropriate frequency.
   You can sometimes [see the movements](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6FFqaLmltY#t=25s).

2. Many frequencies make the glass vibrate, but only a handful make it vibrate
   so much that it cannot stay together. Those frequencies are the resonant
   frequencies&mdash;they make the glass vibrate (i.e. oscillate) much more
   than the other frequencies.

3. Since the glass is insufficiently
   [elastic](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_(physics)>), it shatters.
