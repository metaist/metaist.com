[`ezq` 3.0.0](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/releases/tag/3.0.0) is now published.

- It is a major version bump because it removes all `@deprecated` functions.

- `Worker` vs `Task` vs `Context`: GPT-4 has some good advice about [choosing a good name for the execution context](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/issues/5#issuecomment-1551971894).

- I had a [hard time getting tests to pass on MacOS](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/issues/9). I ultimately switched from [`multiprocessing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html) to [`multiprocess`](https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess). Surprisingly, this did not destroy everything.

- Not directly related, but I tried to figure out [how to use `ssh` on airplane wifi](/blog/2023/05/ssh-on-airplane-wifi.html) while making the release.

## Updates

- 2023-05-21: I had some trouble adding the new dependency correctly, so there were a few additional point releases to fix that. The latest version is [3.0.3](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/releases/tag/3.0.3).
