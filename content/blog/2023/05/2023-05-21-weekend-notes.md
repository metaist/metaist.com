## Releases

- [`ezq` 3.0.0](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/releases/tag/3.0.0); [my brief notes](/blog/2023/05/ezq-3.0.0.html). I then released [`ezq` 3.0.3](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/releases/tag/3.0.3) to fix a dependency issue.

## Posts

A major reason I rebooted the blog is I want to lower the bar for publishing my thoughts and process. One major project I'm working on is recording and building my preferred tools and stack for software development. It's been evolving over the past two decades, so I want to capture what I have now and the kinds of changes I'm considering.
