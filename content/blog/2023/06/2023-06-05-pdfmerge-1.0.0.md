[`pdfmerge 1.0.0`](https://github.com/metaist/pdfmerge/releases/tag/1.0.0) is now published.

Following the principle of "make it easy", I dropped requirements for Windows and upgraded everything to python 3.

In the process of rebuilding `pdfmerge`, I discovered that they type-checker really doesn't like `AttrDict` properties because they can be `Any` or `None`, but my functions typically need a _specific_ type. I had to [resort to calling `cast()`](https://github.com/metaist/pdfmerge/blob/f93dcd20bd7767c6abaf2fdf61179153c864732e/src/pdfmerge/__main__.py#L84) which felt a little gross.

I also realized that while `docopt`-style is great for CLI argument parsing, it's less pretty as markdown documentation, so I had to [add some markdown into the help text](https://github.com/metaist/pdfmerge/blob/main/src/pdfmerge/__main__.py#L26) which, again, felt a little gross, but it's not the worst thing in the world. Maybe in some future version I'll use [`rich`](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) to render the help text so that it gets a nice markdown treatment.
