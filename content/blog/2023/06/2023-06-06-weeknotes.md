Going forward, I'm going to start calling these "weeknotes" following the apparent convention for this kind of thing.

## Releases

- [`attrbox` 0.1.2](https://github.com/metaist/attrbox/releases/tag/0.1.2); [my brief notes](/blog/2023/06/attrbox-0.1.2.html). Because of annoying `py.typed` and `PyPI` issues, I eventually had to release [`attrbox` 0.1.5](https://github.com/metaist/attrbox/releases/tag/0.1.5)

- [`pdfmerge` 1.0.0](https://github.com/metaist/pdfmerge/releases/tag/1.0.0); [my brief notes](/blog/2023/06/pdfmerge-1.0.0.html). I use this about once a week and not having to keep around python 2 feels like a huge relief.

- [`ezq` 3.0.4](https://github.com/metaist/ezq/releases/tag/3.0.4) just to make it `py.typed`.

- [`visual-schedule` 0.1.0](https://github.com/metaist/visual-schedule/releases/tag/0.1.0). This was the inaugural project for [Design Lab](/blog/tag/design-lab/).

- [`srt2txt.py`](https://gist.github.com/metaist/b10433ccc6795d4ed82ef42e0b70a209) a quick gist to aggregate subtitle file by speaker.
