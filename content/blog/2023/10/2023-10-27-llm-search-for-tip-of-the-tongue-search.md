Although I've been playing with ChatGPT for a while, today marks the first time I actually used it to remember the name of a piece of software that was on the tip of my tongue, but Google searches didn't help.

**User**: What is the name of the very fast http server written in rust or maybe in golang that has a standalone executable, very simple configuration, maybe starts with a "C"?

**ChatGPT**: The HTTP server you are referring to is likely Caddy. It's written in Go and is known for its simplicity and ease of use, including automatic HTTPS setup. It provides a standalone executable and has a very straightforward configuration syntax.
