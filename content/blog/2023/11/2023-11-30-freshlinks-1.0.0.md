[`freshlinks 1.0.0`](https://github.com/metaist/freshlinks/releases/tag/1.0.0) is now published.

- I wrote my [first approach to this problem back in September](/blog/2023/09/freshlinks).

- Since then I added [command-line arguments](https://github.com/metaist/freshlinks/blob/1.0.0/src/freshlinks/__main__.py) and a basic [file-based cache](https://github.com/metaist/freshlinks/blob/1.0.0/src/freshlinks/cache.py).
