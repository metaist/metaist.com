[`cosmofy 0.1.0`][release] is available. [Shalev NessAiver] had a great suggestion to turn my post about [bundling python code into Cosmopolitan apps](/blog/2024/08/packaging-python-with-cosmopolitan.html) into a Cosmopolitan app.

To install `cosmofy`:

```bash
dest=~/.local/bin/cosmofy
curl -sSz $dest -o $dest -L \
  https://github.com/metaist/cosmofy/releases/latest/download/cosmofy
chmod +x $dest
```

## Release Notes [0.1.0] - 2024-09-18T18:55:19Z

### Bootstrap

- [#1], [#4], [#12]: bootstrap cosmofy to build itself

The primary purpose of this initial release is to be able to use `cosmofy` to build `cosmofy`.

### Self-Updating

- [#2], [#6], [#8], [#9], [#13]: JSON receipt and schema
- [#3], [#5]: `--receipt-url`, `--release-url`, `--release-version`
- [#7]: `--self-update`, `--self-update --help`, `--self-update --version`

The secondary purpose was to make it easy to add self-updating while bundling the app. I have a [longer post describing how `cosmofy` intercepts python command line arguments](/blog/2024/09/pythonoid.html) to check if `--self-update` is present in `sys.argv`.

### Releases

- [#10]: release notes
- [#11]: auto-upload build artifacts to GitHub Release

Just some clean up to the release notes (which I kept) and having GitHub build the artifacts itself (which I later reverted).
