[`ds 0.1.3`][release] is now published. I had to make 4 separate releases because PyPI really messed me up with name violations.

[`ds`](https://github.com/metaist/ds) is a very simple task runner (like `npm run` or a much simpler `make`) that tries to use the standard project configuration files in many popular languages.

The combined release notes provide enough initial functionality that I've started using `ds` in all my projects to run my usual dev commands.

Install it:

```bash
python -m pip install ds-run
```
