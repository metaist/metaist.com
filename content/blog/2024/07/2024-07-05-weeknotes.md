No major releases of public packages, but I did make some improvements to the blog. More details are in the accompanying posts.

- [#7] Added a simple search box using `pagefind` ([read more](/blog/2024/07/trying-pagefind.html)).

- [#8] Cleaned up the list of posts to show thumbnails when present.

- [#9] Cleaned up the post layout to display an [ISO-8601 date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) and cleaned up the header.

- [#10] Fixed post sort order for (rare) days when I have more than one post per day.

- [#11] Added [OpenGraph tags](https://ogp.me/) for post thumbnail and description.

- [#12] Added automatic page screenshots for pages without thumbnails as a preview of the page you're about to click on ([read more](/blog/2024/07/screenshot-thumbnails.html)).

- [#13] I tried a simple card layout for the homepage, but it ended up looking gross, so I abandoned it. I did add any description, when present, to the list of posts.
