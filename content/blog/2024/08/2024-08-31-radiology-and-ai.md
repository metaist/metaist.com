In my response I mentioned a few aphorisms that come to mind:

"**Slowly at first, and then all at once.**"<br />
AI advances in medical imaging have been coming in fits and starts, but the progress is gradual and increasing.

"**Things are never as bad as we fear nor as good as we hope.**"<br />
There's lots of hype and doom around AI, but both are extreme positions that don't reflect the underlying reality properly. The reality is that there are real improvements, but it's also not the end of the world.

[Amara's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara#Amara's_law): "**We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.**"<br />
In some domains, we're approaching the limits of human ability; some of those [blueberry muffin / dog photos](https://www.instagram.com/crystalleigh/p/CX69g5FP_Mh/) are confusing even for humans. On the other hand, people have been predicting the end of radiologists for a while and it hasn't materialized in a noticeable way.

In summary, I think Radiology as a field isn't quite done yet, but short of union-style regulations that say that only a human can look at the images, it does seem likely that eventually machines will do that work.
