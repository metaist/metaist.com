[`ds 1.3.0`][release] is available. This release represents a shift from only supporting the overlap of all file formats to specific parsers for each supported format.

To install `ds`:

```bash
python -m pip install ds-run

# or, if you use uv:
uv tool install ds-run

# or, install the standalone version:
wget -O ~/.local/bin/ds -N https://github.com/metaist/ds/releases/latest/download/ds
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ds
```

Unlike the official [Changelog](https://github.com/metaist/ds/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), these notes are organized by feature.

### Documentation

- [#53]: changed `README.md` to have a quicker start section

I got some feedback from [Shalev NessAiver] that many HackerNews comments often complain that it takes too long to see real examples, so I tried to illustrate a bunch of salient examples up top.

- [#69]: added documentation for why branch coverage is disabled

I often strive to get 100% branch coverage in unit tests, so if I disable branch coverage, I want to remember why (e.g., hard to model catching `CTRL+C`).

## Logging

- [#76]: fixed logging in normal and debug modes
- [#79]: added more helpful debug messages (e.g., how to enable / disable options)

There are three kinds of logging I use:

1. Tracing execution flow: Where did execution reach?
2. Reporting changes of state: What is the state of the system?
3. Providing information content: What useful things should you know?

One thing I think is interesting is providing some guidance (usually behind a `--debug` flag) is providing information about how to enable or disable particular behavior. This is particularly helpful when you wonder about why the program is behaving a certain way.

## Install

- [#14]: added instructions for using `uv` in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- [#30]: added `uv`, `uvx`, and `pipx` instructions to `README.md`

`uv` is emerging as the dominant alternative to `pip` and all the other python project management tools.

- [#31]: added Cosmopolitan Python build; Actually Portable Executable
- [#72]: Cosmopolitan instructions

[Shalev NessAiver] helped me figure out the two things I needed to build a truly cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) binary executable (using [Cosmopolitan](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan)), which is actually just a very carefully crafted zip file:

1. The special zip commands to add files to the packaged python.
2. How to add arguments so that `ds` runs instead of the python REPL.

With this release `ds` can be installed in three ways: via `pip`, as a `uv tool`, and as a standalone binary.

## Task Description

- [#58]: added `help` task option to display description when using `--list`
- [#61]: improved command wrapping for `--list`

`help` is inspired by `pdm`; adding the command wrapping made it somewhat nicer to look at the output of `ds` as it's running. I wrote a [related post on figuring out how to do wrap bash commands](/blog/2024/08/formatting-bash.html).

## Task Environment

- [#51]: added `--env` and `--env-file` command-line option together with `env` and `env-file`/`env_file` task options for passing environment variables to tasks
- [#83]: moved `env_file` loading later (during run) instead of earlier (during parsing)
- [#84]: changed passing `env` values to `str`

Moving `env_file` loading later lets you generate that file in some task and letting another task read that file.

- [#60]: added `cwd` / `working_dir` task option for where tasks should run

The purpose of this feature is to let you use a config file in one directory and executes the tasks in another directory (i.e. not the directory containing the config file).

## Task Formats

- [#68]: added support for simplified `Makefile` format
- [#72]: fixed `Makefile` links

[Joe Hostyk] convinced me to support a minimal subset of the `Makefile` format. Many people use `make` as a way to alias long commands with a short name. I implemented the aliasing and composites and a few other features when they were relatively easy to implement.

- [#71]: fixed allowing `composite` (prerequisites) and `shell` (recipe) within a single task

While I was implementing the `Makefile` format, I realized that while I allow both `composite` and `cmd/shell` properties on tasks when _running_ the task, I didn't allow them in the _parser_. So I fixed that to more clearly communicate the intent that `composite` represents perquisites that run before `cmd/shell`.

- [#59]: added support for `pdm`-style `{args}` during argument interpolation

This style turned out to be helpful for formats like `Makefile` which use `$@` to mean something else.

- [#66]: added support for `uv` workspaces

Inspired by `Cargo` and easy to support.

- [#82]: added support for `poetry`

`poetry` only really supports a single version of the python `call` format. Previously, I was was against supporting `call`-type tasks because they are language-specific and I had a universal parser for all the file formats. However, once I implemented [#77] and every file format got its own parser, I could reintroduce the concept of language-specific features, and so I added `poetry` back in.

## Task Runner

- [#24]: added `--pre` and `--post` options to run pre-/post- tasks

Several of the formats support some kind of lifecycle event. I was reluctant to add support for these because they obscure the flow of execution. However, I ended up deciding that I could have people explicitly opt-in to running additional tasks with command-line options.

- [#55]: added `--dry-run` command-line option to show which tasks would be run

Unlike `--list`, `--dry-run` will show you the actual command that is about to run (will full argument interpolation, etc.).

- [#57]: added support for glob-like task selector from the command line and in composite tasks

I really didn't like `pnpm`'s solution to use a regex to specify which tasks to run and using globs has felt very natural.

- [#64]: changed allowing shell commands directly when calling ds, e.g., `ds 'echo hello'`

Originally, I thought this was a weird thing to allow and had a special flag to disable it. But now with [#73] and [#74], I routinely just want to execute a command in the context of the project (e.g., `ds 'echo $PATH'`).

- [#65]: `ds` now respects the value of the `SHELL` environment variable when running tasks
- [#65]: tried to detect current `SHELL` on Windows

Detecting the `SHELL` turned out to be surprisingly easy for POSIX machines and hilariously difficult on Windows. I've kept the Windows code as "EXPERIMENTAL" because I don't have a good way of testing it.

- [#73]: added search for nearby `node_modules/.bin`
- [#74], [#78]: added search for nearby `venv` if `VIRTUAL_ENV` is not set
- [#75]: added `--no-project` option to suppress searching project dependencies
- [#87]: moved project detection (`venv`, `node_modules/.bin`) earlier (right before top-level task run) instead of later (right before command run)

[Shalev NessAiver] provided some feedback to the [1.2.0] release suggesting that the project-specific folders should be on the `PATH` without having to activate or otherwise specify them. Currently only project folders for `node` and `python` are supported, but this could easily extend to `php`. One question that is still somewhat open is under which conditions the searches should take place. I'd also like a way to move the logic of the search into the respective file formats, but I don't have a clean way to do that yet.

- [#77]: refactored parsers, runner; each file format now has its own parser

This was the most significant bit of work for this release that barely added any new features. The main goal was to try and parse each file format as strictly as possible while supporting the general goal. A few features that got added were `call` for `pdm`/`rye`/`composer` and argument sharing from `pdm`.

- [#75]: added `--no-config` option to suppress searching for config files
- [#77]: removed `.ds.toml` as a supported file format name
- [#80]: changed config file search order

During work on [#77], I cleaned up the search order and removed the never-used `.ds.toml` file.

- [#81]: renamed environment variable `_DS_CURRENT_FILE` to `DS_INTERNAL__FILE`

While reading bits of the `uv` codebase, I saw this naming convention and decided to switch to it.

**Testing**

- [#67]: added `uv run` command that runs tests against all supported Python versions

This became the topic of my [most-liked tweet](https://x.com/TheMetaist/status/1826262711971520861). The point isn't to run this all the time, but to simulate what GitHub Actions does when running all my tests on every supported version of python.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know you&#39;re supposed to use `nox` to run your unit tests on multiple versions of python, but I just tried using `uv run` and it works!

- [#70]: simplified `CI.yaml`

Just some clean up.
