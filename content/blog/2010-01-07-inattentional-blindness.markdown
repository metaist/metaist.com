## Commentary

[Derren Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown) has demonstrated this
effect with [different races, accents, and even genders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBPG_OBgTWg#t=2m15s)!
While the original studies had a fail rate of 75%, Brown's informal study had
about a 50% fail rate.

## Meta
