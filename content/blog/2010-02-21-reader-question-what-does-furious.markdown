## Summary

[Curling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling) is a 400+ year-old sport about
which I know very little. Wikipedia saves the day again.

## Explanation

Curling is played on level ice. However, droplets of water called _pebbles_ are
added which cause the _stone_ (pictured above) to _curl_ when it travels across
the ice. According to Wikipedia, sweeping accomplishes two goals: to increase
the distance the stone travels, and to change the amount of curl. The strategy
of sweeping seems to involve figuring out when to sweep and how hard to sweep
(apparently that has an effect on the amount of moisture created).

Overall, the point of sweeping seems to be to influence the _curl_ of the
_stone_ by wearing down the _pebbles_.

Do you know more about curling than I do? If so, please contact me so that I
can update this post appropriately.
