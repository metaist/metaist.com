## Commentary

I found myself vigorously agreeing with Dr. Tae's presentation. I was particularly surprised
by the [comment by Lawrence Krauss][1] (emphasis added):

> According to a presentation Krauss delivered to the Canadian Association of
> Physicists' Congress Tuesday, **90 per cent** of U.S. middle school science teachers
> have no post-secondary education in science themselves.

Of course, a lack of _qualifications_ is irrelevant when all you need are _certifications_.

The humanities are [sidelined as well][2] (via **Robert**):

> I know one of your arguments is that not every place should try to do everything.
> Let other institutions have great programs in classics or theater arts, you say;
> we will focus on preparing students for jobs in the real world. Well, I hope I've
> just shown you that the real world is pretty fickle about what it wants. The best way
> for people to be prepared for the inevitable shock of change is to be as broadly educated
> as possible, because today's backwater is often tomorrow's hot field.

In the course of my discussions, some people have raised the following objections to
Dr. Tae's approach. Here are some of the more common reactions:

**_How did Dr. Tae grade the students from his "workshop" class?_**

I don't know, but I can ask him.

I should point out that his experiment was geared at demonstrating a new model of
education&mdash;one in which grades are not emphasized because competence and mastery
are the goals. Nonetheless, the question is valid, because we do not have many
institutions that support his proposed model of education (although compare his model to the
[Yeshiva system][wiki-yeshiva]).

**_Isn't Dr. Tae's model of education very expensive?_**

Perhaps the "workshop" aspect, but definitely not the "distributed teaching" aspect.
The latter might reduce the former if "real" teaching and learning were sufficiently commonplace.

**_Don't some subjects have to be taught in a lecture format?_**

I'm not sure why this would be the case. People learn an amazing variety of information and
skills "outside" of the classroom. I say "outside" to highlight the artificial nature of the
boundary of where teaching / learning occurs.

## Meta

I'm going to contact Dr. Tae in the next few days, so feel free to post questions for him in the
comments below (deadline: Friday, 2010-12-10). I'll write a separate post if Dr. Tae responds.
