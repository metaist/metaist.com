## Commentary

The ideomotor effect is the result of _unconscious_ processing of external
stimuli. While much of the brain's functioning is unconscious, these reactions
manifest themselves physically (typically in movement).

This is how [Ouija boards][wiki-ouija] work. Participants touch a
[planchette][wiki-planchette] and their brain, expecting a response (from the
dead, aliens, or Parker Brothers), which forces small (unconscious!) movements until
the piece moves.
