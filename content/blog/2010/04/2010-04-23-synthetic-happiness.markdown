## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Dan Gilbert](http://www.danielgilbert.com/) has an interesting discussion about
ways in which our "_experience simulator_" (aka
[prefrontal cortex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex)) makes
mistakes&mdash;particularly in judging our future happiness.

## Commentary

Gilbert highlights the notion of [Impact Bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_bias):
"tendency for people to overestimate the length or the intensity of future
feeling states." Example: both lottery winners and paraplegics feel about the
same level of happiness after a year.

Why? Here are some reasons & insights:

- There is a sort of psychological
  [immune system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system) that allows us
  to _synthesize_ happiness.

- Despite our feeling that "natural happiness" (when we get what we want) is
  somehow superior to "synthetic happiness" (when we don't get what we want)
  they are both about the same in quality.

- Synthetic happiness _actually changes_ your intrinsic preferences and
  outlook.

- Irreversible conditions promote synthetic happiness. However, people _think_
  they would prefer reversible decisions.

## Meta

Ever catch yourself synthesizing happiness?
