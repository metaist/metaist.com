powdery substance like sugar and is composed of 95% water.

## Commentary

Jokes about dehydrated water crystals aside, this is a pretty impressive
technique for collecting and containing water which has been around since 1968.
In 2006, it was rediscovered as a potential way to absorb carbon gases and a
host of other applications.

I've got to think back to other 8<sup>th</sup> grade jokes to see what future
technology will bring.
