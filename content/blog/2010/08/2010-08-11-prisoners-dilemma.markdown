## Definition

In game theory, the [prisoner's dilemma][wiki-prisoners] refers to a situation
in which two parties can:

1. cooperate (each gains a moderate amount),
2. defect (each looses a moderate amount), or
3. one defects (gains a large amount), the other cooperates (looses a large amount).

## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

I recently had an interesting experience in which I had to play 9 rounds of an
[iterated prisoner's dilemma][wiki-prisoners-iter] as part of a large group.
The process by which my group decided to behave was both enlightening and
disturbing.

## Background

During the summer, I took a course on [negotiating][wiki-negotiation].
On the last day of class, the professor announced we would be doing a
large-scale group negotiation. He split the class into two large groups of 12
people each and provided everyone with the following information:

[wiki-negotiation]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negotiation

> Each group represents a store in a town where
> [commerce is forbidden on Sunday][wiki-blue-laws]. For various reasons, the
> two stores are now considering being open on Sundays with the following ramifications:
>
> - If both stores are **closed**, each **makes $20,000** during the week.
> - If both stores are **open**, the town will **fine each store $20,000** for that week.
> - If only one store is **open**, that store will **make $40,000** during the week
>   and will actually take business away from the other store for a week, so the
>   the **closed store looses $40,000** for that week.

For those of you playing along at home, here is the [payoff matrix][wiki-payoff]:

    <td>(<span style="color: red">-$40k</span>, <span style="color: green">+$40k</span>)</td>
  </tr>
</table><br />

The two group convene in separate classrooms where for each of the next 12
"weeks" a new representative must exit the room with a sign that says
"Open" or "Closed." The two representatives have the option of negotiating for
up to one minute except after weeks 4 and 8 when they **must** negotiate. This
is because on weeks 4, 8, and 12, the profits and losses double, triple, and
quadruple, respectively.

## Game Play

As the twelve members of my group finished reading the assignment I pointed
out that this was, indeed, the classic prisoner's dilemma game in which we can
maximize our gains by cooperating, although there are short-term gains in
defecting.

A fellow classmate (let's call him Bob) responded saying he did not care;
he just wanted to win. I pointed out that there are a few ways of defining
_win_ in this particular circumstance. Did he mean that we should try to make
as much money as we could? _No._ He wanted to make sure we made more money
than the other team. Okay, I said, but let's focus on the short-term goal here
on figuring out whether or not we should be open for week 1.

Eventually, we came to a consensus that we should be open week 1 as a
precaution. As the first representative to go out, I displayed our "Open" sign
to the amazement of the other team representative. I made a deal, offering to
be closed for the remaining 11 weeks (as my team had proposed), and the other
representative agreed&mdash;provided that they were allowed to open the
following week while we remained closed. Deal.

When I returned, the discussion picked up on a theme that might be described as
"When Should We Screw Them?" Several people agreed that "we have to screw them
sometime," but I was at a loss to explain my position that we should _not_
screw them. In the meantime, we were being pressed to send out representatives
for the following weeks, and we continued to abide by the agreement laid out in
the first week.

Both teams remained closed for weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Our group became
more passionate. We tried to define what our interests were. While we could not
agree what the expression "maximize your profits" (as written in the
instructions) meant, we did agree on the following two principles:

1. We want to have a positive balance at the end of the game.
2. We want to make more money than the other team.

At this point, I raised the issue that I had a very specific interest in
remaining honest. To illustrate my point, I suggested that on week 11 we
_tell the other team to be open_ week 12. I had forgotten that the losses would
quadruple, for my intent was to prevent _anyone_ from cheating on week 12 (when
there would be a strong desire to cheat). This idea did not go over well
("You're willing to loose money to be honest!?"). I tried to backtrack. Okay,
but now&mdash;it's only week 8&mdash;why should we screw them now? Let's
continue to abide by our agreement. They've been abiding by the agreement so
far&mdash;let's just keep going&mdash;we're making money, people!

## Honesty or Profits

Someone calculated that if we screwed them now (week 8), and subsequently
stayed open the remaining weeks (since we assume that they would stay open as
well), we would still be in the black at the end of week 12, while the other
team would be in the red.

We had been summoned to send a representative out for week 8 (our team was
consistently late in sending someone out as our deliberations slowed us down).
At this point our debate reached a fever pitch. Bob of the "I-want-to-win" camp
asked for a vote; should we choose honesty or profits (his words).

So I asked each person: "Honesty or profits?"

Profits. Profits. Profits. Profits. Profits. Profits. Honesty. Profits. Honesty.
Profits. Profits.

My vote was well known at this point, so I didn't even bother announcing my
position. Moments later, one of the votes for "honesty" changed her mind and
agreed that week 8 was an opportune time to screw the other team.

I decided that since Bob was so in favor of screwing the team "at some point,
and it might as well be now" he should be the representative to go and announce
that we were open. As he was walking out the door, I said "This is a stupid
move; you're firing nukes on Russia&mdash;how do you think this is going to
end?" My other classmates asked me "But what if they're open?"
"If they're open," I replied, "then I'm an idiot and I was wrong. But watch,
they are going to abide by the agreement, and from now on, it will just be us
nuking each other." (I choose the Cold War analogy because we had all watched
[Thirteen Days][amazon-13-days] as part of a previous assignment.)

The other team was closed and they were upset. Since negotiations had to occur, Bob
tried to present the situation as "nothing personal"; that our group was
"chaotic" and that it was "impossible to say how things would proceed".

On Week 9, both teams came out "Open", although the other team's sign also
depicted a middle finger. Both representatives made it clear that they would
remain open the remaining weeks, so the professor aborted the game and we
convened for a post-session discussion.

## Post-mortem

During the discussion, it became clear that the other team had plans to screw
us on Week 11 (on the assumption that we would screw them on Week 12). Unlike
our team, they had chosen to make liberal use of the blackboard (we used the
computer screen). Their board clearly showed their train of thought: "Ethics",
"Honesty Is the Best Policy" were followed up by a large "SCREW THEM!" It was
pointed out that despite being told "it's just business, nothing personal"
every single person on their team took it _very personally_.

I raised the issue of how quickly people choose "profits" over "honesty", but
my fellow teammates objected on the grounds that "they were operating within
the game." My professor tried to make the point that "in real-life" people tend
to weigh in the consequences more and that they might be less likely to defect.

Needless to say, I did not find this reassuring.

## Final Score

Despite my feeling that we had "lost" as we broke our agreement (and, in
retrospect, we lost $140k in potential profits), we did satisfy the two
criteria pinpointed by the group: we were in the black, and we made more money
than the other team. Here is the final score:
