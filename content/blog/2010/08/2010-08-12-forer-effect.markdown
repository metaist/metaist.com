## Commentary

Forer famously gave a group of students a personality test. Then he provided
them with an individual "analysis" which the students were supposed to rank
from 0 to 5 (poor to excellent). The analysis read thusly <small>(Thanks
Wikipedia!)</small>:

> You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You have a
> tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused capacity
> which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some personality
> weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Disciplined and
> self-controlled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At
> times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision
> or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety
> and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You
> pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept others' statements
> without satisfactory proof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in
> revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable,
> sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, reserved. Some of
> your aspirations tend to be pretty unrealistic. Security is one of your major
> goals in life.

The average score was 4.26. It was then that Forer revealed that they all got the same text.
