## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The [Arnell Group](http://arnell.com/) is a design company famous for its work
with [DKNY](http://www.dkny.com/) and [Banana Republic](http://www.bananarepublic.com/)

## Commentary

In 2008, an Arnell Group design document called <cite>Breathtaking</cite> was
leaked to the public. The 27-page document was the point of much ridicule as its
contents attempt to explain how the proposed [Pepsi](http://pepsi.com/) logo was
the ultimate realization of thousands of years of good design. Gems include:

- conformance with the [golden ratio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)
  (frequently used in the world of design) (p. 18) and detailed instructions
  on how to construct the logo using the golden ratio spiral (p. 19)

- comparison of the logo to the Earth's
  [geodynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamo) and
  [magnetic fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth's_magnetic_field) (p. 21)

- a 5000+ year timeline of all the "authentic Constitution of Design"
  (culminating with the Pepsi "Breathtaking" logo) (p. 6)

Apparently, the new logo fulfills the destiny of good design in addition to
making Pepsi's logo
[look similar to other modern logos](http://industry.bnet.com/advertising/1000545/new-pepsi-logo-seems-similar-to-three-other-corporate-emblems/).

In 2009, the Arnell Group orchestrated the [Tropicana](http://www.tropicana.com)
[orange juice package redesign](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/business/media/08adco.html).
<small>(Tropicana is owned by PepsiCo).</small> The design met with
[amazing backlash from consumers](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/business/media/23adcol.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all)
(supposedly, there was a 20% drop in sales) and the existing iconic
straw-in-orange design was reinstated.

## Meta

What was your reaction when Pepsi changed its logo? What about Tropicana?
Other companies?
