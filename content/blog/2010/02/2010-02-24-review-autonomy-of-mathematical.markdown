## Review

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Curtis Franks'](http://www.nd.edu/~cfranks/)
(_full disclosure:_ he's is a friend of mine) PhD-turned-book
[Autonomy of Mathematics: Hilbert's Program Revisited][amazon] is an exciting
new look at an overlooked aspect of early twentieth century mathematics. Franks'
writing is crisp and engaging, as he paints the picture of a man and his
philosophy that so many have spurned.

## Commentary

In the 1920's, Hilbert
[launched a program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert's_program) that was
ostensibly aimed at solving the
[foundational crisis of mathematics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundational_crisis_of_mathematics#Foundational_crisis)&mdash;the
issues of paradoxes (e.g., [Russell's paradox](/blog/2009/11/russells-paradox.html)).
The traditional understanding is that Hilbert's program failed because
[G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems)
threw a monkey wrench into any sufficiently sophisticated system that tried to
prove itself.

Franks' thesis is that this is a narrow understanding of Hilbert's goals.
While G&ouml;del's results did complicate certain endeavors, Franks' suggests
that Hilbert was really trying to take back mathematics. That is, certain other
endeavors were trying to resolve the foundational crisis by rooting mathematics
in some _other_ discipline (e.g., philosophy). Hilbert's goal was to keep
mathematics strictly within the realm of mathematics&mdash;a unique feature of
the discipline.

<cite>The Autonomy of Mathematical Knowledge</cite> is admittedly not for
everyone (perhaps not even for me)&mdash;about 20% of the book involves theorems
I faithfully assume describe what the surrounding text tells me they do. Yet,
about 80% of the book is eminently accessible&mdash;the historical context, the
epistemic issues, and the attempt to reconstruct a neglected approach combine
for a great read.
