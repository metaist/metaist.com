## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Mint.com](https://www.mint.com/) is a website for managing your bank accounts,
loans, and retirement funds. For the deeply paranoid, it's a conspiracy to
gather all of your banking information that is already available online in
another place online.

## Review

Mint.com is relatively new (since 2006), yet
[amazingly popular](http://trends.google.com/websites?q=mint.com,quicken.com&geo=all&date=all&sort=0).

As I see it the main benefits of Mint.com are:

- **Transactions** - All your transactions across all your accounts
  <small>(almost; some banks aren't supported)</small>. This includes things
  like your checking, savings, CDs, credit cards, loans, and retirement
  accounts. It's nice to be able to see them all together and categorize them
  appropriately.

- **Graphs** - Being able to easily make visual representations of your
  spending or the trends of your retirement account is nice.

- **Notifications** - Mint can notify you about certain important financial
  moments. For example, they can notify you
  - if your spending seems anomalous <small>(this takes a few months to
    adjust)</small>,
  - when a large purchase clears, or
  - when you are near your credit limit.

Some downsides:

- <strike>**Small Banks** - Even though many institutions are supported, some smaller
  (e.g., local banks) are not, and there's no way to manually import your
  data. (Although, they say it's coming "mid-march.")</strike>

- **Privacy** - Mint has a [strong privacy policy](https://www.mint.com/how-it-works/security/policy/)
  and many implicitly trust its security model. Nonetheless, it's a little
  strange to trust one entity with all of your transaction history
  <small>(_*Cough*_ Google)</small>.

On balance, Mint helps people who are interested in their spending habits get a
larger picture of their income & expenses.
