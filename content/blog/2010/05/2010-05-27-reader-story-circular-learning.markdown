## Story

Imagine you are told you have to use a new internal learning management system
to complete your workplace training. Sounds simple enough. Yet, what if the
system was so [complicated and hard to use][wiki-ux] that you needed to take a
course to learn how to use the system? Moreover, what happens when the course
that teaches you how to use the system is managed by the _**very same system**_?
A [logical implosion][wiki-circ].

## Meta

[Circular reasoning works][1] because circular reasoning works. What experiences
have you had with trying to explain the issues with circular reasoning?
