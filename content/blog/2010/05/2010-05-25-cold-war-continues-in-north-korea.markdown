## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[North Korea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_korea) is an interesting
country that is largely (socially) isolated from the rest of the world.
[VBS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBS.tv) Co-Founder Shane Smith managed to get
into the country during their increased allowance for tourists to watch the
[Mass Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Games) (the latest one was called
"[Arirang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arirang_Festival)").

The videos are long, but fascinating.<br />
Enjoy.
