title: Take The Metaist 2010 Survey! [Closed]
---

## Request <small>(Updated 2010-06-11)</small>

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In the past **The Metaist** had _Feedback Friday_ as a routine way to get feedback
from you (dear reader). Over time (7 months), this became less of way to
solicit for ideas and more of a way to fill space without providing content, so
it was abandoned.

</div><!--more-->

Nonetheless, getting feedback from the readership is important and following a
suggestion by reader **Jeff Klein**, I'm providing a small (4 question) survey
to assess our status. It should take less than 3 minutes to complete and will
be open until **June 4th, 2010**.

Please take this anonymous survey at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,<br />
**_The Metaist_**
