## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In 1991, a group of MIT students attached a fire hose to a water fountain thus
fulfilling former [MIT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology)
President [Jerome Wiesner's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Wiesner) notion
that getting an education from MIT was comparable to getting a drink from a fire
hose.
