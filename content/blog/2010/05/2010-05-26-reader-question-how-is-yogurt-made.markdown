## Summary <small>(for an average six-year-old)</small>

<small>(Based on: [Peanut Butter and Jelly](http://www.kididdles.com/lyrics/p003.html))</small>

1. First you take the milk and you heat it. _<small>(You heat it.)</small>_
2. Then you take the milk and you cool it. _<small>(You cool it.)</small>_
3. Then you take the bacteria and you add it. _<small>(You add it.)</small>_
4. Then it gets [fermented](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(food)>).
   _<small>(Fermented.)</small>_
5. For your yogurt... white yogurt... and berries.

## Explanation <small>(for a smarter six-year-old)</small>

Yogurt is based on the Turkish words for _knead_ and _thick_ although in some
regions (e.g., Bulgaria) it is more like
[sour milk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sour_milk) <small>(which ambiguously
refers to both milk that has soured and
[buttermilk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttermilk))</small>.

The bacteria used in the fermentation process are
[_Lactobacillus delbrueckii_ subsp. _bulgaricus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_delbrueckii_subsp._bulgaricus)
and [_Streptococcus salivarius_ subsp. _thermophilus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_salivarius_subsp._thermophilus)
which convert the [lactose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose) into
[lactic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid) <small>(which is what
builds up on your muscles when you exercise, but
[doesn't degrade performance as previously thought](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid#Exercise_and_lactate))</small>.

Aside from the that the first summary captures the essence of the process.
