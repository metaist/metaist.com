## Review

<p class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[The Checklist Manifesto][amazon], by [Atul Gawande](http://gawande.com/), is a
manager's guide to making the professionals under his charge play at the top of
their game. Throughout the book, Gawande stresses that checklists have a place
in every business sector, from aviation, to finance, and, his main emphasis, in
the operating room of a hospital. He goes to great lengths to show the successes
checklist implementation has accomplished in often short periods of time.

Perhaps the most appealing part of this book is the points Gawande makes about
how a checklist is for everyone at every stage of their career. The need for
checklists, Gawande says, is especially true for those who have excelled in
their positions and feel that they are infallible and do not need to rely on
such checks during their normal work routines. <!--more-->

The book further stress the point
that checklists are an inexpensive tool to implement that can result in large
rewards both physical and financial. Gawande also does an excellent job of
detailing how to correctly implement a checklist in a corporate/hospital
setting, promoting [top-down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down) support of
the project and placing the responsibility for its use in the hands of those
least involved, (i.e. nurses, etc).

Towards the end of the book, Gawande does become a little redundant in his
message. While he does cover it somewhat, more time could have been spent
reviewing the need for checklists in today's world, bringing more evidence for
failures that occur as a direct result of not having a checklist in place.
Nevertheless, Gawande's writing style is easy to read and eloquent, wasting no
words and making his points clear. Gawande is on to something and using his
ideas can produce dramatic results with little cost involved.
