## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Facilitated communication][wiki-fc] (FC) is a process by which a facilitator
supports the hand or arm of a communicatively impaired individual while using
a keyboard or other devices with the aim of helping the individual to develop
pointing skills and to communicate.

## Commentary

Facilitated communication may be related to the
[Ideomotor Effect](/blog/2010/06/ideomotor-effect.html) or the
[Clever Hans Effect](/blog/2010/01/clever-hans-effect.html).
This would go a long way to explaining the facilitator's denial of interference
as well as the subject's inability to answer questions to which the facilitator
does not know the answer (among other anomalies in this form of communication).
