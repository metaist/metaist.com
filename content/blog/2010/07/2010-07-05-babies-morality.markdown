## Commentary

While I'm hesitant to label this as "[bunk]({{BLOG_URL}}/tag/bunk.html)", there appear
to be at least two deficiencies in the research methods used <small>(based on
five minutes of film and not much else)</small>.

The first, pointed out to me by Professor Bitran, is that the caregivers always
hold the children and may unconsciously influence the result (as in
[facilitated communication]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/07/facilitated-communication.html)).

Second, the videos seem to show that the researchers who present the option
_know_ which one is the "good" one. The babies may be responding to the
researcher rather than the choice (similar to
[Clever Hans]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/01/clever-hans-effect.html)). Nonetheless, the
results of better controlled studies might show that a basic understanding of cooperation.
