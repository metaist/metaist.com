## Commentary

The study's posits that "higher income inequality between executives
and ordinary workers" leads to a perception of power that ultimately results in
maltreatment of "rank and file workers" (p. 1). This follows the research on the
[relationship between power and lying][hbr-1] and reinforces the image of
powerful managers who abuse their position (e.g.,
[Emmett Milbarage][wiki-emmett] in _Chuck_).

## Meta

Have you experienced this sort of behavior? What about the opposite (magnanimous
over-paid managers)?
