## Announcement

From the [conference event page](http://academics.holycross.edu/crec/events/conferences/neuroscience):

> How does what we are learning about the brain through [neuroscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience)
> and [evolutionary science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_psychology)
> influence how we ought to think about [ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)?
>
> Recent advances in [functional neuroimaging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_neuroimaging)
> have increased scientists' understanding of how our brains process [moral decisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality).
> Some thinkers suggest that moral decision making is fundamentally an intuitive
> or emotional process, and that what we call "reason" is a post-decision making
> method of justification for actions, not a "higher order" process for
> [making decisions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making).
>
> If so, the new science challenges the [principle of free will](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will),
> the argument that reason is the foundation of moral decision making, and the
> importance of understanding [intentions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention)
> before judging responsibility for action. The potential implications for most
> Western ethical traditions are enormous.
