## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Homeopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy) refers to treatment of
symptoms by extremely diluted versions of poisons that are thought to create
those symptoms. I'll defer to
[The Amazing Randi]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/01/amazing-randi.html) for a nice
explanation of why that doesn't make any sense.

## Commentary

My favorite part: "Non habit-forming." Except for the people who have a habit of
buying homeopathic "remedies."
