## Commentary

<span class="vcard org fn">Wired</span> has an excellent article on the
[increasing effectiveness of placebos][1]. It seems that this increase is
correlated with the lifting of the ban on direct-to-consumer marketing of drugs
by the FDA in 1997.

Other research is focused on determining how placebos work. In one study,
researchers were able to
[see parts of the placebo effect in action in the spine][2] by telling
participants that they were trying out a new painkilling cream against a
non-painkilling cream (both creams were inactive). While the exact mechanism
needs further investigation, this was the first step towards demonstrating the
participation of the spine in the placebo effect.
