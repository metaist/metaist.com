## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Clever Hans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_hans) was a horse that seemed
to be able to perform arithmetic and solve puzzles. However, after a formal 1907
investigation, it was shown that Hans was actually picking up on and responding
to subtle audience cues rather than solving problems.

## Commentary

The [Clever Hans Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_hans#The_Clever_Hans_effect)
is important because it exposes how some of our involuntary reactions influence
or cue others. This is why there are occasionally problems with
[police lineups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_lineup) or
[interrogation of children][1]. It is also why use of
[double-blind experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-blind_experiment)
is encouraged.

_More on this later._
