## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

From Wikipedia:

> [Electromagnetic induction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction)
> is the production of [voltage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage) across a
> [conductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor) situated in a
> changing [magnetic field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field) or a
> conductor moving through a stationary magnetic field.

In other words, magic.

## Commentary

Induction is the principle behind
[generating electricity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_generator),
[most electrical motors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor), and some
["smart" traffic lights](http://www.wikihow.com/Trigger-Green-Traffic-Lights).
It's also how that [little bit of foil gets attached](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_Sealing)
to pill bottles and other containers.

_More on this later._
