## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In 1982, [Arthur Lintgen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Lintgen)
demonstrated conclusively that he is able to identify many classical
[phonograph records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record),
by simply looking at them.

## Commentary

Lintgen never claimed to have any kind of supernatural powers or that he can
read individual notes off of records; he just used his vast knowledge of
classical music and phonograph construction to determine, for example, out how
many movements there are and their relative duration and loudness. His skills
are limited to orchestral music from Beethoven onwards.

## Meta

When I have told this story in the past (as recently as 12 days ago), I made two
errors:

1. I was told that he used his fingernail to play the record very quietly and
   identified it aurally, rather than visually. This was not the case.

2. I was told that he was going to be paid the
   [JREF award](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html), but,
   out of a moral sense, confessed to his true methods. This, too, was not the
   case; he never claimed to have any paranormal abilities; just abnormal
   abilities.
