## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Dihydrogen monoxide](http://www.dhmo.org/msdsdhmo.html) is the name
given to a "colorless and odorless chemical compound" that is pervasive
in the environment. It's also a fancy-pants way of saying water.

## Commentary

In 1997, the [DHMO hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHMO) was revived by
14-year-old Nathan Zohner who brought it to the public's attention. Zohner petitioned
to get DHMO banned as the basis of his science project, titled "How Gullible Are We?"
Many people were very gullible, and this hoax occasionally comes back to haunt
politicians.
