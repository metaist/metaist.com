## Commentary

Cargo cults provide an interesting insight into the development of beliefs and
rituals. The concept of cargo cults
[has been extended](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult#Other_uses_of_the_term)
to include any superficial copy that is disconnected from the underlying
workings.

## Meta

What are other examples of cargo cults?
