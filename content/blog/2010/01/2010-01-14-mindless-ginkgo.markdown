## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Ginkgo biloba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginko_biloba) is a species of tree that is claimed to help prevent [memory loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_loss), reverse the effects of [dementia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia), and prevent the onset of [Alzheimer's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Disease). A [recent study](http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/302/24/2663) showed no such effects.

## Commentary

The study was the latest product of the
[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/)
(NCCAM)&mdash;an organization that uses taxpayer money to design excellent
studies to demonstrate the worthlessness of
[alternative medicines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_medicine)
(such as [homeopathy]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/01/dilute-homeopathy.html)).

This particular study is impressive:

> [The study is a] randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
> of 3069 community-dwelling participants aged 72 to 96 years, conducted in 6
> academic medical centers in the United States between 2000 and 2008, with a
> median follow-up of 6.1 years.

Their conclusion: "Annual rates of decline in z scores **did not differ between
_G. biloba_ and placebo groups** in any domains..." (emphasis added).
Which domains did they test? Among them were memory, attention,
[visuospatial abilities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visuospatial), and
language.
