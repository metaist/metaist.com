_This post is a response to a reader question._

## Question

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Reader **[Matthew Garland][matthew-garland]** asks:

> Where do geological layers come from? If remains of civilizations and eras
> are buried, where did the material for the top layers come from? There can't
> be more material now than five thousand or million years ago.

## Summary

_The answer to this reader question comes from

The formation of geological layers is a continuous process based on the
settling of [sediment][wiki-sediment] and shifts in
[tectonic plates][wiki-tectonic].

## Explanation

Geological layers, also called beds or [strata][wiki-stratum], which contain
buried civilizations are composed for the most part of fragments of rocks that
form when bigger rocks are broken down by water, wind, or even organisms like
plants. Once broken down, the fragments, called [sediment][wiki-sediment], are
transported by flowing water or blowing wind. Eventually, water stops flowing
or wind stops blowing and the sediment settles, be it on the river bed or on
the ocean bottom, or on floodplains alongside rivers when they flood. The
fossil record is primarily a record of what lived in the oceans and in and
along rivers.

Inasmuch as humans are dependent on water for sustenance, irrigation, etc., the
bric-a-brac of human civilizations is ideally located to be buried by sediment
when the rivers flood, which many do seasonally. It is worth noting that floods
add new sediment that maintains the fertility of the floodplains for
agriculture which also keeps humans near rivers.

The Earth does not run out of sediment because mountains constantly form and
grow (slowly) as the [plates][wiki-tectonic]&mdash;the 14 or so massively large
blocks Earth's outer "shell" made of continents and ocean floor&mdash;shuffle
around and collide. As mountains go up, there is always more rock to break
down.

And although adding layer upon layer of sediment does indeed produce an
increasingly thick pile of rock, it need not get higher and higher. There are
two main reasons. First, as old sediment is buried by new sediment, water and
air are squeezed out from the spaces between the sediment, and the old layer
becomes thinner. For example, 10 feet of mud will on average yield a layer of
rock about 1 foot thick. Second, the colliding of plates I mentioned above warps
the ground over a very large area often bending it down to form a
[basin][wiki-sediment-basin] which lowers the Earth's surface.

Finally, I briefly add that sediment, and the oceanic part of the plates, are
eventually recycled by sinking back into the deeper layers of the Earth. Where
plates sink are called '[subduction zones][wiki-subduction]' and are often
apparent on maps as oceanic trenches (e.g., [Mariana Trench][wiki-mariana],
the deepest place on the surface of the Earth). The sinking of plates at
subduction zones initiates the formation and growth of another type of
mountain: volcanos. The ash and debris associated with volcanic eruptions
blanket the surface and frequently bury human structures. The burial of
[Pompeii][wiki-pompeii] and [Herculaneum][wiki-herculaneum] by ash from the
eruption of [Mount Vesuvius][wiki-vesuvius] in 79 CE is one famous example.
