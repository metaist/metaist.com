## Commentary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Many of us enjoy [spicy food][wiki-spicy]. At the same time, many of us really
don't like spicy food. According to an
[article in The New York Times][nyt-pepper], there may be more of a personality
trait to this than one might have originally thought. Additionally, the fact
that any human being likes spicy food might say a lot about the evolution of
our species.

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania say that our enjoyment (or
non-enjoyment) of spicy food might have to with the unique human capability of
getting pleasure out of painful experiences: "Humans and only humans get to
enjoy events that are innately negative, that produce emotions or feelings that
we are programmed to avoid when we come to realize that they are actually not
threats," said [Dr. Paul Rozin][paul-rozin] of University of Pennsylvania, who
calls this trait "**benign masochism**". After all, we are the only animal that
likes spicy food, as evidenced by the inclusion of [Capsaicin][wiki-capsaicin]
(the chemical compound that makes chilies spicy) in many animal repellents.

What this might say about people who do and do not like spicy food is not
covered by the article, but it doesn't take too much thinking to see if people
who like spicy foods are also ones who have a high
[tolerance for pain][wiki-pain-tolerance].
