## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In early 2010, a school in England started a program
to replace 30-minute detentions with a more classical approach.

## Commentary

The UK has a long history of trying to curb
[anti-social behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behaviour),
especially among teens. Recent failed attempts include the
oh-so-popular [Mosquito][3] device aimed at annoying teens with noises
in ranges adults do not hear. Of course, students turned the noise into
a [ringtone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito#Teen_Buzz_ringtone)
to avoid detection of cell phone activity while among adults.

This more recent attempt claims high success (50% reduction) in
deterring student misbehavior and consists of and hour of listening to
[Mozart][wiki-mozart], [Verdi][wiki-verdi] or [Bach][wiki-bach]
in addition to [public shaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame#Shame_campaign).
Additionally, students have to watch a DVD on mathematics and spend
half and hour writing about what they have learned.

## Meta

This seems like it will have negative consequences for the Arts in the future.
It's hard enough to [get people to appreciate classical music]({{BLOG_URL}}/2010/12/dr-tae-on-teaching-and-learning.html);
this policy just reinforces the notion that classical music is boring or torturous.
