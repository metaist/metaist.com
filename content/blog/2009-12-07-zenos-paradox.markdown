## Summary

[Zeno's Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's_paradoxes) involves a race
between a tortoise and Achilles that suggests that motion is an illusion.

## Commentary

I remember when I was first introduced to this paradox in 8th grade; it was
utterly puzzling (until I heard a solution). A simplified version goes something
like this:

> Achilles and the tortoise are having a 1000 paces race, but the tortoise has a
> head start of 800 paces (Achilles is much faster than the tortoise). As the
> tortoise inches forward, Achilles makes a plan.
>
> First, he'll get to the halfway point (let's call it Bob) between himself and
> the tortoise. Of course, to get to Bob, Achilles realizes, he has to get to the
> halfway point between himself and Bob (let's call it Jane). And before he can
> consider anything else, he must first get to the halfway point between himself
> and Jane (called Sam). [...]

As Achilles continues to think through his plan, he realizes he can never even
catch up to the tortoise, let alone win the race. When viewed abstractly, the
problem seems to show that nothing can ever pass anything else&mdash;that motion
is an illusion. Until the early 20th century, there wasn't really a way to
handle this paradox appropriately. However, with the advent of infinite series,
we can say that the reason Achilles _does_ pass the tortoise is because if you
add up all the little pieces (<small>1/2</small> + <small>1/4</small> +
<small>1/8</small> + <small>1/16</small> ...) you get 1 (which represents the
total distance between Achilles and the tortoise).

**Fun fact**: Zeno's paradoxes are considered some of the earliest examples of
_[reductio ad absurdum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum)_,
also known as proof by contradiction.
