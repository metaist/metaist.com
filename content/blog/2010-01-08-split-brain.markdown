## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Split-brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_brain) is when the two
hemispheres of the brain (left & right) are not connected. This is often due to
surgery in which the [corpus callosum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_callosum)
is severed to avoid the spread of [epileptic seizures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epileptic_seizures).

## Commentary

One might think that severing all of the connections between the two hemispheres
would lead to significant impairment of functioning, yet the two halves continue
to communicate&mdash;just outside of the body (e.g., writing, talking,
pointing).

There have been cases, however, in which patients
[behave as though they have two personalities](http://www.psywww.com/intropsych/ch02_human_nervous_system/split-brain_operation.html):

> Case 1...would sometimes find himself pulling his pants down with one hand and
> pulling them up with the other. Once, he grabbed his wife with his left hand
> and shook her violently, with the right hand trying to come to his wife's aid
> in bringing the left belligerent hand under control. Once, while I was playing
> horseshoes with the patient in his backyard, he happened to pick up an ax with
> his left hand. Because it was entirely likely that the more aggressive right
> hemisphere might be in control, I discretely left the scene-not wanting to be

I wouldn't want to be the test case either.
