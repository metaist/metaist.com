## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Boredom][wiki-boredom] is the feeling that
you can't possibly pay attention to what is going on.

People who are bored often seek distractions to keep
them occupied, which may lead to fewer opportunities
to integrate your thoughts.

## Commentary

Scott Adams (of [Dilbert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert) fame)
wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that
the current trend towards distraction is leading to a
[lack of boredom][1] and, consequently, to a lack of
[creativity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity).

However, proneness to boredom has been
[linked to depression][2] and other psychological issues, so it
is probably not the fount of creativity. However, opportunities
for introspection and reflection&mdash;like those
found during [meditation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation)
or [daydreaming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daydream) might be
better explanations for creativity in low-stimulation environments.
