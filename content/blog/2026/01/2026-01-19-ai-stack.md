{% linkPost title, tags, link %} The argument Hamel makes is compelling: why fight the AIs in their preference for tools and frameworks. My counter is: I still want good taste. Also his point about "Everyone is more polyglot" is why I think my [`ds`](https://github.com/metaist/ds) task runner might still have a chance-- it's built for polyglots.
