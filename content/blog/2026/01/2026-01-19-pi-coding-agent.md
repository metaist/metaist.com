{% linkPost title, tags, link %} Armin has been going on and on about `pi`, but I couldn't figure out which coding agent he meant until [he posted a link to it](http://shittycodingagent.ai/). After a few days using Claude Code (more on this later), I switched to using `pi-coding-agent` and haven't looked back. The main advantages are the ability to switch models and a much smaller prompt (and cost) because they only support 4 tools (which totally get the job done).
