## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Steve McConnell has compiled an excellent list of
[25 classic mistakes][link-1] that are made
during [software development][wiki-1]&mdash;many of which apply to
[project management][wiki-2] in general.

## Commentary

The enumerated mistakes are grouped into four general categories:

1. People
2. Process
3. Product
4. Technology

The first two categories could be describing almost any project. The third
and fourth are more specific to software development. Many cover issues related
to human [assessment of risk][meta-1] and our poor ability to judge future states
(e.g., [optimism bias][wiki-3]).

Personally, I'd like to see more [version control][wiki-4] on non-software development
projects. Three professionals I think are ripe for using version control:
secretaries, lawyers, and politicians. All three are in the business of moving documents
around. The latter two are more transparent when we see what changes have been made
(more reason for them to dislike this approach). Overall, the amount of back-and-forth
could be dramatically reduced if version control were used (e.g., tumblr
[posted their policies on GitHub][link-2]).
