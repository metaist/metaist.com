## Commentary

The difference between a pretotype and a [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype)
is that the latter answers the question "**Can** we build it?" while the former
answers "**Should** we build it?" Moreover, pretotyping focuses on using the
minimum of resources (time, materials, effort).

Alberto Savoia has written a little booklet about pretotyping which is,
itself, a pretotype. People told him he should write a book about pretotyping,
so he wrote a booklet (in days, not months) to test out whether there is
sufficient interest in the topic before he spends more time writing about it.

The booklet covers several different pretotyping techniques such as
_The Pinocchio_, _The Mechanical Turk_, and the _The False Door_.
Some of the others were interesting, but I did not find them nearly
as actionable as these.

There's also a rich discussion about how most ideas fail and how to avoid
falling into _Thoughtland_&mdash;a world in which all ideas are great and where
there's no evidence to back up any claims.

### The Pinocchio

_from a block to a real product_

This technique is best for physical devices and is similar to
[dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). It is named
after the [fairy tale character](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Pinocchio)
and is based on the story of how the [Palm Pilot](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)#Initial_development>)
was created. One of the inventors [Jeff Hawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins)
carried a wooden block and stylus in his shirt pocket and pretended to use it
throughout the day. After some time, he realized that he would use this product,
if it were actually built.

### The Mechanical Turk

_replacing complex machinery with humans_

The name of this method comes from an [elaborate 1770 hoax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turk)
about a chess-playing machine that was later revealed to be box with a human player concealed
inside. [Amazon Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com/) service which facilitates
[crowdsourcing]({{BLOG_URL}}/2009/12/crowdsourcing-crowd-wisdom.html) is named after this
same device.

Savoia illustrates this technique with a story from IBM which was considering entering
the voice-to-text market. Since building a working prototype would have been prohibitively
expensive, IBM presented the _appearance_ of a prototype to prospective customers
(a computer monitor and microphone were on display, but the microphone led to an adjacent
room where a typist converted the voice to text). The initial enthusiasm&mdash;on
which IBM considered betting the company&mdash;dwindled as people realized the
limitations of such a system (sore throat, lack of confidentiality, etc.)

### The False Door

_measure the frequency of use of an unimplemented feature_

This technique requires a certain amount of care. It is best illustrated in an online
context: create an advertisement for your prospective product which leads people to
a landing page explaining that the product is not finished, but here's what the price
will be when it is released. Oh, and here's a place you can sign up to get a discount
when it comes out.

Now you are equipped with three numbers:

- how many people saw your ad (impressions)
- how many people clicked on your ad (clicks)
- how many people signed up for your list (sign ups)

If the latter numbers are low, there's little chance your product, as stated
will succeed. Fail fast and try again.

In some ways, this is similar to Eric Ries'
[Minimum Viable Product](http://venturehacks.com/articles/minimum-viable-product).

## Meta

My favorite part of <cite>[Pretotype It][2]</cite> is the fact that
it is, itself, a pretotype.
