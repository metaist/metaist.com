## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Quality](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(business)>) refers to the superiority
of an item over another. [Quantity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity) refers to the
number of items.

There is a long-standing debate about whether students should focus on quality or
quantity in order to improve their performance.

## Commentary

I once heard an interesting anecdote that I later saw repeated by [Jeff Atwood][1]
and attributed to the book <cite>[Art & Fear][amazon]</cite>.

Here's the version I heard (it differs only slightly from the printed version):

> On the first day of class, a pottery professor divides his class in two:
> The first group will be graded on **quality**&mdash;by the end of the semester,
> each person must produce one item which will be judged based on its quality.
> The other group will be graded purely on **quantity**&mdash;the total weight
> of all the items produced will be weighed with higher numbers given higher grades.
>
> By the end of the semester, each person in the **quantity** group had produced
> works of higher quality than any of those produced in the **quality** group.

The second group had the opportunity to experiment and learn while the first
was focused on refining an initial conception. The result seems less surprising
when you think about it that way.
