## Commentary

One of the brilliant things about Khan Academy is that it allows teachers to
"flip the classroom"&mdash;what used to be lecture is now watched at home at
one's own pace (with freedom to rewind), and former "homework" is now done
in class with the teacher providing assistance.

In addition to videos covering math (basic addition through pre-calculus),
there are other videos on history, finance, art, and more. Moreover, many of the
math videos are connected to auto-generated problems sets which make it easy to
practice the concepts. For teachers (Khan calls them Coaches), there is detailed
information about students' progress.

As expected, there are detractors who fear a loss of jobs and who argue about
whether or not drills are the most effective learning tool. My take:

1. An inability to cope with change makes for poor teachers. Teachers are students
   for life.

2. I tend to advocate a learn-by-doing approach for many subjects. Admittedly
   this is difficult in the humanities and arts, but I find that it is a lack
   of creativity rather than an inherent obstacle. For math, this involves _doing_
   a lot of math problems. The more instantaneous the feedback the better because
   waiting a week to see if your understanding was correct is absurd.

   I do see merit in expanding [numeracy education][meta-1]. However, Khan does
   take the time to explain what he is doing and the fact that kids (and adults
   who are using Khan as a review tool) are excited about learning (math!) while
   demonstrating improvement suggests this approach is working.
