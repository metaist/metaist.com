## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In [automation][wiki-auto], engineers ensure that the system is a
well-controlled [state][wiki-state]. When there are many variables
in play, and something goes wrong, resetting the system to a known state
is a common tactic to regain predictable behavior.

It can also help you find your keys.

## Commentary

> <big>A place for everything, and everything in its place.</big> <br /> > &mdash; _Benjamin Franklin ([and others](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/14400.html))_

While resetting large, somewhat unpredictable, systems to a known state is critical,
the lesson can also be applied to daily life.

When I was in high school I found a small 7.5in. x 4in. wooden box. I had seen stores
sell [valet trays](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HX8692),
but they looked awkward; for me, this little box was sufficient.

Victorian notions of propriety aside, the major benefit of putting things away in a
predictable location is the ease with which they are found&mdash;and the corresponding
savings in time.

As the number of virtual places (e.g., file systems, email) we can "put" stuff increases,
this principle becomes more and more relevant.

- When flying, I thought the purpose of resetting the trays and seats during take
  takeoff and landing were to put the system in a known state. Apparently, it's more for
  [emergency evacuations][faa-1] and to avoid physical shock.
