## Commentary

A benefit of [pretotyping](/blog/2011/09/pretotyping.html)
is that you start to explore who your potential customers are before
you invest heavily in creating a product.

Jason Cohen, founder of [Smart Bear Software](http://smartbear.com/),
had the opportunity to listen to hundreds of starts make their pitch
to get [venture capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital).

He sums up his position with harsh, utterly pragmatic advice:

> <big>If you can't find ten people who say they'll buy it, your company
> is bullshit.</big>

In a [later podcast](http://blog.asmartbear.com/sb-live-2.html),
Jason clarified that he's not talking about a lot of money: $10-$50
to demonstrate their commitment. The important point is that you're building
something that actually fulfills a need; one for which people are willing
to pay.
