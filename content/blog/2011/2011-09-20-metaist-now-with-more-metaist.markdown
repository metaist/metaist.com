but there are few changes you might want to know about.

## Changes

- **Layout** - The new layout if fluid (images resize if you resize the
  browser) and focuses more on content and typography. I was strongly
  influenced by Dmitry Fadeyev's post
  <cite>[What's Left?](http://www.usabilitypost.com/2011/04/15/whats-left/)</cite>

- **Thumbnails** - If you click on a [tag](/blog/tag) or an
  [archive](/blog/archive) you'll see thumbnails of the posts which
  should make it easier to find things.

- **Comments** - For now, if you want to comment on something,
  [email me](mailto:metaist@metaist.com). The existing comments feature was
  nice, but most useful content was submitted via email. I was also influenced
  by Ted Dziuba's
  <cite>[Blog Upgrade][1]</cite>
  and his irreverent style.

- **Posts** - A few posts (e.g., "Feedback Friday" posts) were deleted after
  moving over because they don't align with the new direction of Metaist (see
  below). Everything else should be pretty much where you expect it.

I don't intend to remove the old site anytime soon, so it will still be out
there (although I may redirect people here after a while).

## Meta

So why change now?

Originally, I hadn't intended to move the blog at all. The purpose of
metaist.com was to host my portfolio of projects&mdash;which is still the case.
However, as I was involved in that process, I realized that I could also manage
my blog from the same place, so I decided to write a blogging platform to do
just that.
