<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Dan Meyer][dydan] argues that current math curricula focus
too much on stepping a student through the process without
cultivating a patience for problem-solving.

## Commentary

Meyer's presents a succinct overview of current math education:

> [Math teachers] sell a product to a market that doesn't want it, but is forced
> by law to buy it.

I'm sure many students feel that way about education in general, but somehow math
became the favorite subject to hate.

Meyer separates mathematics into two large chunks: computation (number-crunching)
and math reasoning (applying mathematical concepts). The former, he argues, is easy to
forget, but also easy to re-learn&mdash;provided you have mastered the latter.
Math reasoning (related to [numeracy][meta-2]) is harder to teach.

Meyer's analysis is insightful; he demonstrates how we create a student culture that
expects problems to be simple and well-defined. Textbook examples appear to be completely
disconnected from the real world. His advice points us towards creating problems that are
more realistic and in whose outcomes the students are personally invested. The examples he
brings are wonderful, and could provide the missing component to tools like
[Khan Academy][meta-1].
