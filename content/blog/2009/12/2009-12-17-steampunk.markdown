## Definition

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Steampunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) is a genre of science
fiction that imagines what the world would be like if Victorian steam-powered
technology persisted into the modern era. It also refers to a visual style
commonly associated with the late 18th to early 19th century as applied in a
modern context.

## Commentary

While I've never read any of the
[zombie-enhanced literature](/blog/2009/11/zombies-in-math-and-literature.html),
I do appreciate the resurgence of interest in 19th-century, albeit with a darker
twist.

At its core, steampunk represents a culture of anachronism that is part of the
[cyberpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_derivatives) speculative
fiction genre. I should note that this is similar to, but distinct from, the
activities endorsed by the
[Society for Creative Anachronism](http://www.sca.org/) which targets pre-17th
century Europe.
