## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Many decisions in life require a delicate balance of trade-offs in order to get
the best results. Recent examples highlight the need to restore such balance to
everyday policies especially for so-called "[Zero-Tolerance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_tolerance)" policies.

## Commentary

Schneier wrote a nice article on
[zero-tolerance policies](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/11/zero-tolerance.html)
which he refers to as "zero-discretion" policies. He brings up the recent story
of the [cub scout who brought a camping utensil to school](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/education/12discipline.html?_r=1)
as an example of an unbalanced policy gone awry.

Zero-discretion policies stem from the need to avoid inappropriate
discrimination, that is
[to be "fair"]({{BLOG_URL}}/2009/11/fairness-equity-equality-and-relative.html).
To that end, no discrimination&mdash;no matter how warranted&mdash;must be
allowed. You know you're dealing with a zero-discretion policy when the enforcer
of the policy agrees with you, but "those are the rules, I can't do anything
about it."

Schneier recommends a four-pronged solution:

1. **Rules** - Start with the rules & procedures.

2. **Discretion** - Throw in a dash of discretion to taste.

3. **Appeals** - Add plenty of opportunities for people to appeal.

4. **Audit** - Stir occasionally to ensure smooth consistency.

In short, provide some room for interpretation (discretion), and then make sure
that that room doesn't get abused (appeals & audit).
