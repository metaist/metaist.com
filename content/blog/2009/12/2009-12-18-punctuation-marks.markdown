## Commentary

I remember once getting a lesson on the importance of commas:

> Russian [Tsars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar) would issue verdicts by
> placing a single comma in pre-written papers that said
> **"Death forbidden pardon."**

**Guilty:** "Death, forbidden pardon."

**Not-guilty:** "Death forbidden, pardon."

And so, I was told, a single comma could save your life. There has been a
resurgence in the [life-saving virtue of the comma](http://www.google.com/search?q=lets+eat+grandpa).
Jest aside, a few years ago Canada saw a
[$2 million dollar comma dispute](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20061026/185156.shtml).

Occasionally, someone tries to invent a new punctuation mark, but they are
rarely successful. A notable exception was the invention of the
[emoticon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon) that now pervade informal
written communication (of the typed, but not handwritten, variety). Emoticons
were first proposed by [Scott Fahlman on September 19th, 1982](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sef/Orig-Smiley.htm).
The number and types of emoticons has grown to the point where they may be
considered a form of micro-[ASCII art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art).

Recently, there was an attempt to re-purpose the
[interrobang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrobang) to represent a
[unit of levels of abstraction](http://cuiltheory.wikidot.com/what-is-cuil-theory)
based on the very large, but mostly irrelevant,
[Cuil search engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuil).

**Fun fact:** The old Metaist logo used the
[because and therefore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therefore_sign) punctuation
symbols from logic and math.
