## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Motivation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation) is an important part of
our lives. Managers seek motivated employees, teaches search for ways to
motivate their students, and investigators try to piece together people's
motives. Dan Pink discusses the "mismatch between what science knows and what
business does."

## Commentary

The important distinction in motivation is whether the motivator is _intrinsic_
or _extrinsic_. Intrinsic motivators are ones that you feel you can control,
such as your level of effort, whereas extrinsic motivators are outside of your
control: rewards, punishments, etc.

Pink quotes from a 2005 commissioned by the Federal Reserve of Boston called
"<cite>[Large Stakes and Big Mistakes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100410083618/http://www.bos.frb.org/economic/wp/wp2005/wp0511.pdf)</cite>".
Some random excerpts (emphasis added):

- "With some important exceptions, we observed that **high reward** levels can
  have **detrimental effects** on performance" (abstract).

- "[O]ne mechanism via which increased motivation can backfire is when it
  leads to greater self-consciousness" (p. 3).

- "[T]he performance of participants was always lowest in the high-payment
  condition when compared with the low- and mid-payment conditions
  together..." (p. 13).

- "Many existing institutions provide very large incentives for exactly the
  types of tasks we used here &ndash; those that require creativity, problem
  solving, and concentration. Our results **challenge the assumption** that
  increases in motivation necessarily lead to improvements in
  performance" (p. 19).

- "[W]e were **surprised by the robustness** of the effect..." (p. 19).
