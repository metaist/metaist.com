## Summary

[Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/help/wave/about.html) is a new technology
that is supposed to combine three existing technologies:

1. Email
2. Instant Messaging (IM), and
3. Wikis.

## Email

Most of us are familiar with email. Briefly, it's static distributed content. In
other words, one person can send out some information to a bunch of other
people.

## Instant Messaging

Instant messaging, however, is dynamic&mdash;you interact with another person
(or multiple people) at once.

## Wikis

Wikis are collaboratively editable documents. The most famous example is
[Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org/), but there are others (including private
wikis such as those found within corporations). Wikis are basically
"dynamic content". So now, the content itself can change over time, but everyone
can see previous version of the content if they choose.

## Wave

Google's conception of a Wave, therefore, is a wiki where you see the changes in
real-time (sort of like [Google Documents](http://docs.google.com/)). Here's how
it works:

1. You create a new wave and add some collaborators.

2. The new wave appears in the collaborators "inbox".

3. Any collaborator (including you, the creator) can start to edit the wave.

4. Anyone looking at the wave (i.e. one of the collaborators) can see who's
   editing (and where on the page they're editing) in real time.

5. The wave can have robot collaborators who perform menial tasks (like
   "replace all the YouTube links with YouTube videos").

6. The wave can also have "gadgets" that collaborators interact with (such as
   a "survey gadget" that surveys people).

7. At any time, you can scroll back to see previous states of the wave all the
   way back to its creation.

## Uses

So where would you use a wave? The answer largely depends on how you handle
collaboration. Nature has a write-up about how
[scientists could use waves][nat-1]
to collaborate and use robot collaborators to comb through papers and
cross-reference, for example, gene names in databases. More mundane uses might
include organizing a camping trip, but you're really only limited by your
imagination.

## Meta

Have you used Google Wave? Did you find it useful? What did you like / dislike?
