## Commentary

In 2008, the children at the
[Golden Sunbeam Montessori School](http://www.goldensunbeam.com/) in Ghana
received a most welcome gift: a merry-go-round. But unlike other carousels, this
one generates electricity that is used in [LED lamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_lamps).
A zip-line that generates electricity is set to go into operation soon.

## Meta

What other naturally fun forces could be harnessed (but not enslaved)?
