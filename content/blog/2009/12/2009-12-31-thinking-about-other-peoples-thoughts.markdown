title: Thinking About Other People's Thoughts

## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The right [temporoparietal junction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction)
(rTPJ) appears to be
[dedicated to thinking about other people's thoughts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#Brain_mechanisms).
You can alter people's judgments of others by interfering with the rTPJ's
activity.

## Correction

In the video, Rebecca Saxe mistakenly attributed the following quote to Alan
Greenspan when it was actually said by
[Robert McCloskey](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Knowledge):

> I know you believe you understand what you think I said, but I am not sure you
> realise that what you heard is not what I meant.

## Commentary

Moral thinking is critical in many
[legal systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_systems_of_the_world). In
fact, the [insanity defense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense)
depends on demonstrating that the defendant is _incapable_ of moral thinking
(temporarily or permanently). I imagine this research has far-reaching
consequences.

## Meta

Suppose you know that someone has a deficient rTPJ; how does that alter your
perception of their judgments?
