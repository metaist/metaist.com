## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Chiropractors make numerous claims about their ability to treat symptoms by a
method called [chiropractic subluxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertebral_subluxation)
(not to be confused with [medical subluxation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subluxation)
which is visible in x-rays). A group of chiropractors has shown that the work of
[chiropractors provides no benefit over physical therapy][chiro-2].

## Commentary

Like [homeopathic remedies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy)
<small>(a rant for [another day](/blog/2010/01/dilute-homeopathy.html))</small>,
many have suggested that subluxation is ineffective. Simon Singh was
[sued for libel](http://gimpyblog.wordpress.com/2008/08/17/the-libellous-simon-singh-article-on-chiropractors/)
for writing an article highlighting the ineffectiveness of chiropractors (the UK
has "interesting" libel laws).

However, Harriet Hall, of the
[Science-Based Medicine](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=3022) blog,
suggests that the "death knell" of chiropractic may have been rung. It is one
thing for members of a profession to be introspective; it is another for them
systematically refute the entire basis of their own profession. In the study
they published, the chiropractors used a standard method for establishing
causation known as [Hill's Criteria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill's_criteria#Bradford-Hill_criteria).
The criteria show the _possibility_ of a causal relationship; not that it
definitely exists. Yet, subluxation **_fails to satisfy any of the criteria_**.
Sounds pretty bad for a field that's existed for 114 years.

## Meta

What other professions should apply similar systematic rigor to their claims?
