## Commentary

Crowdsourcing is a popular concept that harnesses the
[wisdom of crowds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_of_Crowds) to solve a
problem. This communal wisdom is especially popular online where we vote, rate,
and assess content. James Surowiecki published a book called
[The Wisdom of Crowds](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385721706)
on this subject <small>(I haven't read it)</small>.

Many famous demonstrations involve a large audience guessing the number of
jellybeans in a jar and having the guesses averaged. There have been interesting
discussions about [how it works](http://blog.asmartbear.com/ignoring-the-wisdom-of-crowds.html),
[how it fails](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/the_dirty_little_secret_about_the_wisdom_of_the_crowds.php),
and [how it could have saved us from the financial crisis](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124260235584228407.html).
