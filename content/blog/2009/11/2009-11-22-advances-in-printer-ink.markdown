## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

A recent IEEE Spectrum featured an article about an
[advance in ink-less printing called ZINK](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=5292025&arnumber=5292045&count=21&index=15).

## Commentary

As consumers, we're familiar with the
[high price of ink](http://www.pcworld.com/article/112199/why_do_ink_cartridges_cost_so_much.html).
If you think [gasoline is expensive](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/fuel-consumption/gas-price.htm),
how's [$8,000 a gallon](http://www.ebusinessforum.com/index.asp?doc_id=7159&layout=rich_story)
for HP ink? And it doesn't help that many printers have been
"[designed](http://arstechnica.com/hardware/news/2007/06/study-inkjet-printers-are-filthy-lying-thieves.ars)"
to [produce false out-of-ink messages](http://consumerist.com/282784/printers-prompt-for-ink-replacement-before-ink-is-out).

There have been several attempts at lowering the cost of printer ink. In 2007,
[Kodak introduced a printer][nyt-1]
that used their "pigment-based ink" and was supposed to revolutionize the
printer world. I'm not sure how successful, they've been, but it put the issue
of ink pricing at the forefront of many consumers minds.

The most recent attempt at overcoming printer ink pricing comes from a
[Polaroid](http://www.polaroid.com/) spin-off called [ZINK](http://www.zink.com/)
<small>(for Zero-ink)</small> that has been working for decades on creating
colorless, ink-less paper that uses localized heat to change the color at each
point. Several companies have cameras that also print 2x3 inch photos using
ZINK: the
[Polaroid PoGo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb%255Fss%255F4%255F9%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dpolaroid%2520pogo%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Daps%26sprefix%3Dpolaroid%2520&tag=themet-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957),

and the [TOMY xiao](http://www.engadget.com/2008/11/06/tomy-xiao-digital-camera-has-built-in-zink-printer-the-spirit-o/).

It's fascinating to see the old fallen giants Kodak and Polaroid wake from their
slumber and try to compete in their former markets adapting to the digital
realities of today. If their technologies advance and expand, we may see a
disruption in the printer market similar to that of the '80s.
