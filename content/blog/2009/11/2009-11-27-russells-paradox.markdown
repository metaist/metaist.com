## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Russell's paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_paradox) describes a
fundamental conundrum with [set theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory)
that is sometimes illustrated by way of a story about a barber.

## Paradox

_This presentation is a modified version of Russell's original presentation._

There once was a platoon of men who were very punctilious about following
orders. One day, the commander decided that the men needed to look less
disheveled. One of the men, a barber named Bob, proposed that he shave everyone
everyday. Some of the men complained and asked if they could shave themselves
instead. As a compromise, the commander ordered Bob to shave all and only the
men who do not shave themselves.

The paradox is this: who shaves Bob? If he shaves himself, then he ends up being
_prohibited_ from shaving himself. In which case he _must_ shave himself.
Continue ad infinitum.

## Commentary

The significance of this paradox was that it undermined the existence of certain
types of sets, potentially undermining all of set theory. There were some
[interesting responses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFC), but
[ultimately G&ouml;del showed ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems)
the inescapable nature of such paradoxes for most logical systems.
