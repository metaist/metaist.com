## Definition

A [zombie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie) is typically a reanimated
corpse. Also known as the "un-dead."

## Commentary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

While zombies are not as popular as brains, the former are increasingly the
subject of discussion. For example, the recent film
[Zombieland](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1156398/) and the video game
[Left 4 Dead](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EHD9GA)
both feature zombies.
Various [defenses](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samsmith/243104896/sizes/l/) and
[survival guides](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400049628)
exist to help you deal with potential zombie attacks.

However, the emergence of zombies in non-entertainment fields is interesting. David Sirota of <span class="vcard org fn">In These Times</span> has an interesting article on <cite>[The Zombie Zeitgeist](http://web.archive.org/web/20100326134113/http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/5025/the_zombie_zeitgeist/)</cite> which discusses this new/old phenomenon and how society is dealing with
"apocalyptic anxiety".
