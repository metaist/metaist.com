## Review

<p class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Ramit Sethi (that I guy I quote a lot), author of the website
[IWillTeachYouToBeRich.com](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/),
[published a book by the same name][amazon] about personal finance for
twentysomethings.

</p>

Although I knew the book would not differ much from the content available on his
website, it was pleasant to have Ramit's thoughts presented in close proximity
to each other rather than spread out across the years I've been following his
blog.

Most of his advice revolves around a single theme: **stop loosing money by doing
nothing**. It occurred to me that while in the world of economics, such appeals
to [opportunity cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) are
customary, the world of twentysomethings would much rather feel guilty about
doing nothing rather than actually figuring out what needs to be done and doing
it. _(Please pardon the gross oversimplifications; there are many responsible
twenty year-olds, but few who think they can do anything about their finances.)_

<!--more-->

The blog contains much, if not all, of the advice in the book, but the book
highlighted three things I had failed to implement (though I read them on the
blog). First, I finally took
[Ramit's advice about negotiation](https://web.archive.org/web/20090602164754/http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/negotiation/),
and negotiated a bill. I clearly have more work to do in that department, but it
was good to have a plan of how to approach the conversation, and not feel weird
about talking about money. To Ramit's credit, he portrays negotiation as
asymmetric warfare: you, a novice in negotiation, are battling with experts who
negotiate with people every day. However, you needn't become a Spartan to
negotiate effectively. In fact, being pleasant (and smiling) makes it even
easier. Negotiation is a fascinating phenomenon in the world of human
interaction; it has elements of conflict, optimization and compromise. Each
party seeks to optimize results that favor him or her, yet done right both
parties can win. A critical part of Ramit's advise is to avoid yes-or-no
questions when you really want to ask "**how can we make this work?**" That one
question saved me $180 (over six months) for 2 minutes worth of effort.

The next piece of advise I had failed to implement was to synchronize your bills
with your paycheck (to the extent possible). The idea is to have a more
predictable and automated flow of money. While I've got much of the flow nailed
down, I never thought to change the billing date to a common date; we'll see how
this works out over the coming months and years.

Lastly, the book provided a clearer perspective on what it takes to buy a house.
Again, this isn't anything that Ramit hadn't said previously about
[buying a house](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020123014/https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-buy-a-house/). It was
just easier to focus on his points when I was reading a book (about finance!)
rather than reading my daily blogs. The only change in behavior this created was
creating a little "dashboard" for important goals. Previously the goals were
general (house, travel, etc.); now they are very specific (20% down payment,
trip to California, etc.). This small change forced me to also estimate the cost
and, by extension, the date of fulfillment of each of the goals. Again, the
payoff is mostly psychological, but it helps take down some
[psychological barriers](/blog/2009/11/psychological-barriers.html).

Overall, I recommend this book to most people as an example of how to set up an
automatic system that helps alleviate certain kinds of stress. It's an excellent
short read and his good humored presentation doesn't hurt either.
