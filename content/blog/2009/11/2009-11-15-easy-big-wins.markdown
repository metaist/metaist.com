investment are better than the alternative optimizations. Furthermore, most
popular optimizations do not deliver high returns on investment.

## Technique

Ramit Sethi outlines (in eye-catching ways) how one can figure out which
optimizations are worth your effort. Mostly, his advice hinges on
[differentiating yourself from everyone else](http://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/the-craigslist-penis-effect/):

> As you can see, many Big Wins are actually easily within reach&mdash;_if_ you

> have a few areas of life where you'll have to go up against formidable
> competition, many other areas of life are wide open.
