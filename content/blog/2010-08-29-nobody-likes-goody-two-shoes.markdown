## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The term _goody two-shoes_ is based on a children's story in which a poor
orphan girl (Margery Meanwell) goes through life with only one shoe, but is
eventually rewarded with a pair of shoes earning her the nickname Goody
Two-Shoes. The phrase "goody two-shoes" refers to an excessively or annoyingly
virtuous person, but has now come to include a connotation of insincerity

## Commentary

A recent set of studies at Washington State University showed that not only are
people who abuse a public good excluded from the group, but so are people who
give too much toward the group, but use very little of that good. The fourth
study in the set suggests that such behavior "is seen by some as establishing
an undesirable behavior standard and by others as a rule breaker"
(Parks & Stone, 2010). Regardless of the perception, people wanted this
unselfish person removed from the group.

I'm assuming that "establishing an undesirable behavior standard" means
something like "setting the bar too high" or "making me look bad."
Alternatively, people might assume mixed motives and become wary of such behavior.

## Meta

Do you remember a situation in which you felt someone was being too unselfish?
How did you react? Have you ever noticed you were being excluded after you
behaved unselfishly? What could you do differently?
