## Commentary

Probing the origin of a behavior&mdash;especially in a corporation&mdash;is
one of the keys for improvement. A similar method is "[5 Whys][wiki-2]" in which
you probe for root causes (much like a child asking "Why?").

However, simply understanding the origin of an issue, or even understanding
how something _might_ be done differently is rarely sufficient. There are
often major political and social pressures against change ([status quo bias][wiki-3]),
and sometimes the issue is that [you're doing the wrong thing][meta-1] (ineffective rather than
inefficient).
