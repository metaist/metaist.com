## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Taking risks is part of everyday life. For the most part, people are good at
dealing with risks with which they are familiar. Certain types of risks,
however, when "intuitively" processed, lead to suboptimal behaviors.

## Commentary

Schneier writes about risk a lot: our
[intuitions about](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/08/risk_intuition.html),
[overreactions to](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/12/nut_allergy_fea.html), and
[essential need for](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2009/03/the_zone_of_ess.html)
risk. The most common failures of our risk intuition stem from
[cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
related to rare, unknown, or voluntary risks.

In general, we tend to think that people are
[risk averse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_aversion). But sometimes people
seem to seek out risks&mdash;such as playing the lottery. Why? A possible
explanation is the [framing effect](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)>).
Consider the following case. You can have one of the following applied to your
order:

- A $5 **discount**, or
- A $5 **fee waived**.

Which did you choose? The first sounds like you're getting a good deal; the
second sounds _meh_. **_But they result in the same price!_**

Now imagine there's probability thrown in for good measure. Which of the
following sounds like a better insurance sales pitch:

- There's a pretty good chance you won't loose anything.
- There's a small chance you'll loose a lot.

Now compare that with a lottery sales pitch:

- There's a pretty good chance you won't win anything.
- There's a small chance you'll win a lot.

In the first case (insurance), avoiding the loss sounds better. In the second
case (lottery), the large gains seem attractive. In each case, the way the
situation is framed changes which options seems better.

_More on this later._
