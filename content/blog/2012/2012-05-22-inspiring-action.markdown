## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Simon Sinek][wiki-1] argues that companies that organize
themselves around a _purpose_&mdash;that can answer the almost
[teleological][wiki-2] question: "Why do you do what you
do?"&mdash;are more successful at inspiring action than
those that merely focus on their [value proposition][wiki-3] (what you do)
or on their process (how you do things).

## Commentary

Sinek describes a _Golden Circle_ in which the three
approaches (What, How, Why) map to different regions
of the brain ([neocortex][wiki-4] and [limbic system][wiki-5])
and affect people's perception of trust and loyalty.

> People don't buy _what_ you do, they buy _why_ you do it.

I particularly enjoyed the example of the [Wright Brothers][wiki-6]
who had neither the capital, the market conditions, nor the expertise
but who doubled down on their purpose and persevered while the best
equipped faltered.

## Meta

In case folks don't know, Metaist is driven by a desire
to make people better at achieving their goals. Making people's
experiences richer and more informed is icing on the cake.
