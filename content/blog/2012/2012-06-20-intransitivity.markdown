## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

In math, [transitivity][wiki-1] is a property of relations
such that if **A** is related to **B**, and **B** is related
to **C**, then **A** is related to **C** in the same way.

An [intransitive relation][wiki-2] is one in which this pattern
does not hold.

## Commentary

I've often thought that there is a bias towards thinking that most
relations are transitive. But transitivity is actually a rare case.
It makes reasoning simpler (e.g., the [friend of my friend][wiki-4] is my friend),
but is often simply not true: If **Bob** is friends with **Alice** and
**Alice** is friends with **Eve**, **Bob** might not actually be friends
with **Eve**.

Most preferences are intransitive which is why we have a
[hard time choosing among multiple options][meta-1] and
why [voting paradoxes][meta-2] exist. Moreover, most real options
involve multiple dimensions, so we run the risk of
[errors of multiple comparisons][meta-3].

So, you're trying to pick a movie to watch? (Let's leave out
other people's preferences for this example.) Say you prefer
movie **X** over **Y** and **Y** over **Z**. However, when
you compare **X** and and **Z**, you find that you like **Z** better.
Yep, you're either comparing different features between the films, or
the "prefer movie X to movie Y" relation is intransitive.

Keep this in mind next time you catch yourself or others assuming
that a relation is transitive.
