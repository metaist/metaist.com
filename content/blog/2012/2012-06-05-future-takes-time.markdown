As some parts of society evolve faster than others, we should
remember to be patient with the process.

## Commentary

Some areas of society have changed so rapidly that the _lack_ of change
in other areas is noticeable. Below are some things that appear to exist
only by virtue of the status quo.

### Education

[Invisible Script][link-1]: You go to school to become an <code>X</code>.
From that point on you introduce yourself as an <code>X</code> and people assume
you're like those other <code>X</code> people they know.

Why do people assume they'll always have this career? If economic conditions change,
what are you going to do when we don't need <code>X</code>'s anymore? Riot? Demand
more jobs? Yeah good luck with that.

### Security (or any real Policy)

[Theater][meta-2]: We should try to stop _all_ terrorists. We can do this by
reacting to _[every attempt][link-2]_ to scare us.

Reality Check: The [only thing we have to fear is fear itself][link-3]. What about
some [evidence-based policy][wiki-1]? Yeah, that'll lead to
[policy-based evidence making][wiki-2]. We'll need to be careful about that.

### Corporate Behavior

Why do corporations / politicians ([notable exceptions aside][link-4])
behave as though we're not humans? (I have a theory; more on this later.)

So people who lost much of their savings are likely to stick around in jobs
longer&mdash;together with people who really
[dislike their jobs][link-6]. As a result, Dilbert
becomes a [passive-aggressive signal of displeasure at work][link-5].

### Law (especially [Intellectual Property][wiki-3])

[Billable hours seems like a crap way to make money][link-7].
That's just my opinion though. However, it does seem like the legal
profession is ripe for a huge [refactoring][wiki-4].

Regarding intellectual property: the number of legitimate reasons for
claiming to own an idea are dwindling. They are non-zero, but the reality
of society is that we have made it [exceedingly easy to share and remix ideas][link-8],
so restricting that behavior results in restricting culture.

### Putting it All Together

Technology is changing faster than the larger society can adapt. There are waves
of adaptation. First, a small community of people engage with a technology and start
to explore its potential (e.g., the Internet and GPS started as military applications).
Next, a group of dedicated folks start to push the limits of the technology. Later,
the technology becomes a commodity. Yet, the social and legal implications are rarely
known at this point. Then, after a protracted incubation period, the social norms
become established. Finally, the legal precedents and rulings are adjusted to make
sense of where we ended up.

But the process is long and arduous and there's no guarantee we'll come out
for the better. And while we should be patient, we should
[argue against policies for status quo's sake][link-9].
