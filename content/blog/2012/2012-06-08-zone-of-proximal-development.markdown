a theoretical construct for engaging a student above
the level of [boredom][wiki-2] and below the level of [anxiety][wiki-3].

## Commentary

ZPD relies on [instructional scaffolding][wiki-4] to provide support
to a student above his/her level of competence, but below an anxiety-inducing
level. ZPD is widely used in the video game industry to
[train players on how to play the game][link-1]. In usability, ZPD plays a role
in determining how to structure exposure to features in order to build up
confidence and skill.
