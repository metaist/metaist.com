## Commentary

[Longitudinal studies][wiki-3] that have been replicated around the world do
present powerful evidence that controlling one's impulses has wonderful
benefits.

However, we should also note that there are many [psychological barriers][meta-1]
that need to be overcome in order to improve one's willpower. This is not a
trivial task.
