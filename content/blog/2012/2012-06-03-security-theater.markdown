## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Security theater][wiki-1] is term coined by [Bruce Schneier][link-1]
to describe security measures that make us _feel_ more secure rather
than _actually improve_ our security.

## Commentary

Security theater is what happens when there is a disconnect between how
we feel about our own security, and what the actual security measures accomplish.
While the cases in which security theater leads to waste are numerous (e.g., [TSA][wiki-2])
there are some cases in which it is actually helpful. For example, Schneier pointed out
that after the [Chicago Tylenol murders][wiki-3],
[tamper-evident][wiki-4] safety-seals were introduced to help make people feel safer.
Yet, those seals are not truly effective against stopping a determined attacker.
Nonetheless, since the _actual_ risk of death is low (i.e., the murders were a fluke),
using such seals brings our feelings of security in line with the reality.

One of the reasons that it's so hard to get rid of security theater stems from the
asymmetric rewards that policy makers have: by making people feel safer, a policy maker
is shielded from accusations that they didn't do _everything possible_ to prevent the attack.
Since there is no way to prevent all attacks, the measures continue to increase in response
to every attempted attack in order to further avoid blame. Schneier claims that the only
way to break the cycle is for the [population to refuse to be terrorized][link-3].
