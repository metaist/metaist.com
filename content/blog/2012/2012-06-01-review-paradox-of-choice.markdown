## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The _Paradox of Choice_ consists of our:

- preference for _many_ (rather than _few_) options when making a decision,
- larger likelihood of dissatisfaction when choosing from a large set of options
  (rather than a small set).

In Barry Schwartz's [Paradox of Choice][amazon], he argues that our desire to expand
our available alternatives is actually making us less satisfied with whatever we end
up choosing.

## Commentary

Schwartz sees two major strategies for making a choice:

- maximizer - tries to make **best possible** choice
- [satisficer][wiki-1] - tries to find **first suitable** choice

The difference is that a satisficer is operating with a specific set
of criteria in mind. Once the criteria are met, the search is over.
Meanwhile, the maximizer continues to search for the best deal and
can never really be sure that there isn't a _better_ deal out there.
As a result, the maximizer suffers from the perception that any defect
in his choice _might_ have been overcome by some hypothetical other option.

It's almost as if for maximizers
"[it's not in the last place you look](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Sandman)."
