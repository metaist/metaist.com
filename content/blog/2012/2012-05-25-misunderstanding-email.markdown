## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

People tend to misinterpret emotion in written communication
more often than in face-to-face interactions. Yet, they are
more confident of their assessment.

## Commentary

Misunderstandings arise in any form of communication. For example,
when I was in high school, a friend of mine who had missed a Shakespeare
test called me on the phone and asked about some of the topics that were
covered. At one point he asked:

> Are there quotes on the test?

Having just taken the test and been surprised at the large number of quotes
I responded (with strong emphasis):

> KNOW quotes!

In the context of the conversation, I thought it was perfectly obvious
that I was communicating the idea that one should study the quotes carefully.
But look at that homophone! (Note that constructed languages like
[Loglan][wiki-1] try avoid precisely this kind of ambiguity.)
Later, after having taken the test, he came up to me and asked how I
could have said that there weren't any quotes!? I was shocked,
since I thought I gave him specific direction regarding this exact issue.
Moments later, we realized what happened.

This episode shaped my understanding of how communication is parsed by
others. More recently, there has been research into the effects of
different modalities on communication. One bias that caught my attention
was the dramatic difference between how well people _think_ they understand
emotion over email (very well) versus how well they _actually_ perceive
emotion (very poorly).

So the next time you think you know how someone feels based on an email from
them, try calling or talking to them in-person.
