## Commentary

Researchers at the University of Rochester have [published a new study][science-1]
that shows that performance on the [classic marshmallow experiment][wiki-1]
is influenced by perceptions of environmental reliability.

The major impact of this study is that [deferred gratification][meta-1] is now
shown to be mediated by the environment instead of being a "personality trait".
