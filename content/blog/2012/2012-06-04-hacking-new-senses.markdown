## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The [sensory cortex][wiki-1] is the main region for processing
tactile senses. Yet, recently, the sense of touch has been
repurposed to provide additional information such as sight,
direction, and other new senses.

## Commentary

Hacking the human brain to add new senses seems like only a matter of time.
Sufficient [neuroplasticity][wiki-2] should allow us to add, fuse, repurpose,
and restore sensory experiences. One possible consequence is that people will
have such [drastically different experiences][wiki-3]
(e.g., xkcd's "[Umwelt](http://xkcd.com/1037/)"), that they will increasingly
disassociate from each other.

On the other, things could be really awesome if we jointly produced a more accurate
description of the world by combining our various sensory information.
