## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

There is a common misconception that [creativity][wiki-1] and
[innovation][wiki-2] are either the result of personal disposition
or the result of [divine inspiration][wiki-3]. In fact, many
aspects of creativity can be taught and one can improve their
creative output over time&mdash;like any other skill.

## Commentary

One of the fascinating things about humans is their ability to learn and adapt.
Creative thinking is not exceptional&mdash;like any other skill it can be
improved with ([lots of][meta-1]) practice. Children are naturally creative
because they make many loose associations which foster the type of non-linear
thinking required for creativity. Unfortunately, during those years when they
should be fostering that ability, most
[schooling systems focus on obedience][meta-3]
