## Summary

When we invest in a _process_, _outcomes_ become less important
and have less of an impact on our happiness.

## Commentary

One of the downsides to investing in outcomes is that we drive ourselves to believe
that _if_ I had X, _then_ I'd be happy. This causal relationship, however, keeps
us changing the target, so we're never really satisfied.

However, by focusing on the process, we accomplish two things:

1. We are actually thinking about how to move towards a goal.
2. We remove our dependency on the outcome, and are free to actually get there.

I am reminded of an interesting perspective on [Steve Job's approach][hbr-1] to avoiding
the [Innovator's Dilemma][wiki-1]: by reducing the focus on profits, Apple was able
to focus on passion&mdash;which actually produced higher profits.
