## Commentary

A circular version of Parkinson's Law coined by **Jeffrey Klein** states:

> Bureaucracy expands to accommodate the expanding bureaucracy.

The importance of understanding Parkinson's Law relates to how much
of a resource (such as time) you allocate to tasks, departments, etc.
Every entity&mdash;corporate and otherwise&mdash;tries to maintain it's own
survival. This is usually accomplished through signals of growth such as
increases in budgets and personnel.

For a personal efficiency standpoint, you can sometimes constrain your time
and continue to produce the same level of output (e.g.,
[fixed schedule productivity][link-1]).
