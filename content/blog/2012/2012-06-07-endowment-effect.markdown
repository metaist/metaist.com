## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Once we own something, the [endowment effect][wiki-1] describes
the degree to which we don't want to sell it.

[Or maybe not][link-2].

## Commentary

There is some controversy about whether or not this effect [actually exists][link-2].
Despite the issues with adequate subject controls, this idea is applied widely
to [corporate fiefdoms][wiki-2], [artist's work][link-1], and other areas.

It's tempting to think that we think of our own items as having a higher worth
than those of others, but it might not be the case.
