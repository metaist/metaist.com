## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

[Game Theory][wiki-1] is the study of decision making using mathematical models.
Despite it's theoretical-sounding nature, Game Theory is applicable to
many real-life decisions. One of the interesting features of Game Theory is
unexpected (for humans) results given a set of assumptions.

## Commentary

If there's a decision to be made, there's a game-theoretic model
of that decision. It's not always easy to compute, but it exists.
Things like the [Prisoner's Dilemma][meta-1] are the result of
game theory analysis.

## Meta

In the video above, Ibrahim's decision about whether to choose
"Split" or "Steal" is morphed into a meta-game about whether or not
he wants to get any money at all. While I relish this approach,
it looks like it can only really be used once on this show because
future participants will have to doubt the veracity of the claim
"I'm going to steal, so just choose split."
