## Summary

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

Finding out that a cherished strategy has a dark side
is like meeting your [doppelg√§nger][wiki-1]; you feel impressed
by the similarities, but the differences are terrifying.

## Commentary

One of my favorite approaches to solving a problem is to think about
the meta-problem&mdash;and how to solve that larger problem. In some
ways this is similar to [root-cause analysis][wiki-2], because both
solve a class of problems larger than the immediate problem given.

Recently, I discovered an abuse of the meta approach&mdash;a dark side
that prevents people from getting any work done. Instead of solving
the meta-problem, it creates meta-work. For example, let's say we believe we
need to [paint a bikeshed][wiki-3].

My approach is to find out _why_ we need to paint the bikeshed because
that will drive the decision about whom we hire and what we expect for results.

The dark side, however, asks us to immediately enumerate criteria for selecting
paint colors&mdash;something that expert painters know how to do. The new work
can then be argued _ad infinitum_ because we can now argue both about which
criteria have been selected, as well as how scores were chosen.

There is rarely an objective mechanism for selecting among preferences
(that's what makes them preferences). The result is getting caught in a meta-loop
in which no actual work is done.
