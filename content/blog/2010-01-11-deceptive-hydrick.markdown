## Commentary

Hydrick had a cult following in early 1980s after appearing on several
television shows where he demonstrated his "psychic powers" by
[moving a pencil on the edge of a table](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cS6DjeBz7g#t=4m35s),
[flipping pages of a telephone book](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cS6DjeBz7g#t=5m48s),
and making dollar bills spin under a fish tank. <small>(Amazing, right?)</small>

James Randi [challenged Hydrick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CASghTzNhc#t=2m28s)
on <cite>That's My Line</cite> hosted by Bob Barker.
[According to Randi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cS6DjeBz7g#t=6m47s),
Hydrick took about 25 minutes to do the page flipping trick, and 45 minutes
under Randi's [Styrofoam conditions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CASghTzNhc#t=2m28s)
before giving up.

In 1981, journalist (and former magician) Dan Korem managed to convince
Hydrick that he, too, had psychic abilities, and then eventually
[elicited a confession](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJG5OaoKU2I) that
Hydrick was just full of air.
