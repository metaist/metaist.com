desires and motivations in terms of tiers of fulfillment.

## Commentary

The basic premise behind [Maslow's hierarchy][wiki-maslow] is that people's
needs are organized in such a way that when lower needs (e.g., sleep) are
unfulfilled, it is impossible to focus on higher needs (e.g., self-esteem).
Recently, a friend questioned the nature of this hierarchy citing examples of
religious people who clearly appear to be fulfilled at the highest level
(self-actualization), yet lacked many of the securities provided by the lower
levels (e.g., food, employment, health).

Alderfer proposed a revised version known as
[ERG Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERG_theory) in which needs are also
grouped into _Existence_, _Relatedness_, and _Growth_ categories. However,
neither of these theories explains how people could work on higher levels while
lower levels remain unfulfilled.

## Conjecture

A possible explanation might be the inverse of the "regression" theory that
Alderfer proposed. He suggested that when a higher need was unfulfilled, lower
needs received more attention. I propose that if a higher need is
over-fulfilled, lower needs can be (temporarily) ignored.

## Meta

Is it useful to organize human needs in this way? I'm aware of some applications
in education and business, are there any others? Do you know of alternatives?

- A friend suggested that perhaps only people who have had lower levels
  satisfied in the past are able to refocus efforts into higher levels when
  those lower levels are subsequently unfulfilled because they at least
  _experienced_ those levels.
