## Summary

[Indigo Children][wiki-indigo] are children with special traits, although the
specifics of those traits ranges from "empathetic", "confident" to
"mind reader".

## Commentary

According to Lee Carol, co-author of "The Indigo Children", the term was never
supposed to denote anything paranormal. Rather, Nancy Ann Tappe, who coined the
term, had [synesthesia][wiki-synesthesia] and associated these children with the
color indigo.

Nonetheless, there is definitely an underlying argument that is completely
unsubstantiated: that these children "represent a higher state of human
evolution". Of course, if we take [evolutionary psychology][wiki-evopsyc] to its
extreme, the children _do in fact_ represent a higher state of human evolution
(just not that much higher; probably not what the indigo folks mean).

## Meta

Reader **Matthew** suggests that perhaps a belief in indigo children may be related to the
[Forer effect][meta-forer] and [confirmation bias][wiki-confbias]. What do you
think?
