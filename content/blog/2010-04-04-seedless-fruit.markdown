## Fun Fact

<div class="entry-summary" markdown="1">

The term "[seedless fruit][wiki-seedless]" is a botanical
[contradiction in terms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxymoron) because "fruit"
are typically defined as having seeds.

## Commentary

According to [Wikipedia][wiki-seedless], seedless fruit are the result of either:

1. fruit that develops unfertilized ([parthenocarpy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenocarpy)), or

2. aborted ovules or embryos that didn't produce mature seeds
   ([stenospermocarpy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenospermocarpy)).

The former gives us seedless cucumbers, the latter gives us seedless grapes and
watermelon.

## Meta

Does anyone know if [Fruitarians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitarianism)
are for or against the reproductive rights of fruit?
