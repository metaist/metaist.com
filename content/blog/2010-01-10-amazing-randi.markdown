## Commentary

James Randi is the founder of the
[James Randi Educational Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi_Educational_Foundation) (JREF)&mdash;an
organization that claims to be "an educational resource on the paranormal,
pseudoscientific, and the supernatural." JREF also has a
[$1 million dollar challenge](http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/1m-challenge.html)
for concrete evidence, in the form of a mutually-accepted test procedure, of
paranormal or supernatural powers. No one has ever won
[the prize](http://www.randi.org/challenge/goldmansachs.pdf).
