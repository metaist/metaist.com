## Introduction

At Metaist LLC ("**Metaist**", "**us**", "**we**", and "**our**") respect your privacy and acknowledge the sensitive nature of personal data that you may share with us through using our websites or mobile applications ("**Service**").

We have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information in connection with operating our Service. This Privacy Policy describes the practices concerning the information collected about you by us when using our Service.

In addition, this Privacy Policy explains the rights and choices available to you with respect to your personal data.

We ask that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy should be read together with our [Terms of Service](/terms). By using the Service, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying [Terms of Service](/terms), both of which govern your use of the Service.

## Information We Collect

We will obtain information about you through your use of the Service. We may collect your personal information, whether from you directly or automatically.

For those parts of a service that require an account, you will register using your Google or Apple account and we will extract certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on such account permit us to access.

We will need this information to facilitate your access to the Service and validate your login for your security, as well as to restore and recover your account and its associated data on another device.

In addition, we will collect, process, and store your personal data to provide you with our Service, as follows:

- **Name, email address, photo**: For _account-based Services_ to create your account and provide personalized Service.

- **IP address (static or dynamic), browser type, browser language, referring and exit URLs, date and time or visits**: For _website-based Services_ to provide the Service or to determine your approximate location for statistical and analytics purposes.

To summarize, we mainly use your data to provide you with our Service. Additional data about your use of Service is required to analyze and fix technical issues, enhance and improve the Service features.

We may also aggregate and/or de-identify any information that we collect, such that the information no longer identifies any specific individual. We may use, disclose, and otherwise process such information for our own legitimate business purposes — including historical and statistical analysis and business planning — without restriction.

By creating an account with us you explicitly consent that we may store and process your data (as detailed above), that you provide through the usage of the Service and process solely for the purpose of providing our Service, personalizing our Service and improving our Service features. You may withdraw your consent to this use of your data at any time by deleting your account.

By using our Service and our website you consent that we may collect your usage data under a unique identifier, for the purposes of tracking, analysis, and improvement of our Service.

### Data Retention

We retain personal data for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed, unless applicable law requires storage for a longer period of time.

## How We Disclose and Share Your Information

We will not sell, rent, or license your personal information; however, we may share information about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, as follows:

### Affiliates

We may share your information with our affiliates for legitimate business purposes, including, processing operations, such as data hosting and maintenance.

As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, sale of assets, dissolution, or similar event, we may share your information as part of the transaction.

### Third Party Service Providers

We may use third party service providers (including cloud storage and web hosting providers) to host the Services and store data processed in the scope of the Service.

### Legal or Regulatory Obligations

In addition, we may disclose and/or share your information to comply with legal or regulatory obligations (including to comply with a court order, judicial subpoena or other subpoena or warrant), industry standards, judicial process, and our policies, as well as to protect against, identify, investigate, prevent and respond to fraud, illegal activity (such as identifying and responding to incidents of hacking or misuse of our Service), and claims and other liabilities.

## How We Protect Your Personal Information

We apply security measures to protect against the misuse, loss, and/or alteration of personal data under our control. Despite these measures, however, we cannot and do not guarantee that information will be absolutely safe from interception or intrusion during transmission or while stored on our system, or otherwise.

When you create an account as part of using our Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account password and for any activity that occurs under your account. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.

The account that you use to login (Google or Apple) will store your password. We will not track or store any passwords.

When your data is transmitted between your device and our servers it will be encrypted.

## Communications, Notifications, and Device Settings

We may use your personal data, such as your email address, to contact you with messages and notifications. You may consent to push notifications, in-app messages, surveys, text messages, and emails to deliver Service-related content, such as suggestions for activities or recommendations to improve your mood levels. If you disable any of the aforementioned communication channels, part of the Service may be impacted. You can choose to opt out of being contacted at any time.

## Uninstall

You can stop all new data collection by us by uninstalling our application using the standard uninstall process for your device. If you uninstall our application from your device, the unique identifier associated with your account will no longer be stored. If you reinstall the application and log in with your same credentials, we will not be able to re-associate this identifier to your previous activities and uses of the Service.

## Information Relating to Children

We do not knowingly collect or use personal data from children under the age of 16 years old (or older if required in an applicable jurisdiction to comply with applicable laws). If you are not over 16 years old (or older if required in an applicable jurisdiction to comply with applicable laws) then DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR USE THE SERVICE. If we gain actual knowledge of the information from or about a child under the age of 16 years old, we reserve the right to immediately delete the account and wipe all related information from our servers. You are responsible for any and all account activity conducted by a minor on your account.

## Updates to Our Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time, to reflect changes in our practices and Service or changes in applicable laws. When this Privacy Policy is updated, we will update the date of this Privacy Policy accordingly. Continued use of the Services after such date constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to how your personal information is collected, accessed, or otherwise used as a result of your use of the Services or if your rights under this Privacy Policy are materially impacted by changes to our privacy practices, we will inform you by additional means such as notification to your email address. Please check this Privacy Policy periodically for changes.
